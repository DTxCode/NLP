To optimize my parameters I first tested different activation functions with 10 nodes in the first hidden layer.
The best resulting function (based on accuracy) was the identity function. I then proceeded to test different number of nodes
in the first hidden layer (1-10). Ultimately 1 node in the first hidden layer returned the best accuracy based on the cross-validation process, with a 
score of 0.9462. The data is listed below:
