jblack: have to head out now...catch up later I guess
morning
spiv: ?
carlos: time for almuerzo dude
jordi: that's in your case, not in mine :-)
:)
wow, database/schema/Makefile hurts my eyes
daf: why?
it's pretty hairy
I'm glad I don't have to maintain that
:-P
carlos: "aleatory"?
daf: ?
+                # XXX: Carlos Perello Marin 03/12/2004: Epiphany seems to have an
+                # aleatory bug with upload forms (or perhaps it's launchpad because
daf: random O:-)
es? :)
my spanglish, you know
ah :)
en_ES :)
yeah :-P
daf: are you going to fix it?
or should I do it?
I'll do it
carlos: don't use "if type(x) is Foo"
daf: why?
if you must do type checking, always use "if isinstance(x, Foo)"
daf: I think Steve said we should use it instead of isinstance
really?
daf: remember the proxy thing
hmm
are file uploads security-proxied?
if you use isinstance you get a proxy object instance instead of what you want
daf: no idea
Merge to rocketfuel@canonical.com/launchpad--devel--0: fix bug with losing languages parameter from URLs (patch-1132, daf@canonical.com)
jblack, is there something I can do in case a merge --two-way fails with "PANIC: unable to fork for hook"?
salgado: this is a bug in baz
salgado: perhaps you can use "baz merge --star-merge --two-way"?
daf, yeah, I've seen the bug, and this is why I tried the --two-way. 
I'm going to try with --star-merge now
daf, https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4756
isn't this?
oh, right
I got the error when executing the hook, not when running diff
thanks
Merge to rocketfuel@canonical.com/launchpad--devel--0: various changes to the translation page (patch-1133, daf@canonical.com)
daf, np. ;)
daf, running with --star-merge --two-way worked for you?
"baz merge --star-merge"" worked for me
2005-01-01T03:41:00.000Z	daf	I didn't use --two-way
2005-01-01T03:52:00.000Z	dilys	Merge to rocketfuel@canonical.com/launchpad--devel--0: add initial canonical.rosetta.tar library (patch-1134, daf@canonical.com)
2005-01-01T04:28:00.000Z	lamont	so what is the baz equivalent of 'tla tag' again?
2005-01-01T04:30:00.000Z	daf	baz branch?
2005-01-01T04:31:00.000Z	lamont	thanks
2005-01-01T04:58:00.000Z	carlos	sabdfl: hi
2005-01-01T04:59:00.000Z	carlos	sabdfl: now that malone is open to the world, could we use it to track the rosetta's bugs?
2005-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	sabdfl	carlos: good idea!
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	carlos	sabdfl: what should be done?
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	carlos	just create a Rosetta product and that's all?
2005-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	sabdfl	carlos: create a project called ""The Launchpad"
then create products for malone and rosetta
ok
so we can file bugs against them there
we can use the dogfood server for security-related bugs till we have a security bug tracking feature in malone
sabdfl: should we add a link to malone at the main launchpad web page?
hola people
jordi: hey
ok, it's ready
carlos: do I need a separate malone account?
no
ok
jordi: same account
as it insists in telling me to "join"
?
ohh, that link...
it's broken at the moment...
so don't worry about it
jordi!
carlos: yes please, just a small one :-)
sabdfl: could we "kill" the join link ?
the foaf part of launchpad is closed and I think it will confuse the userd
/s/userd/users/
hi mark!
hey, I got #3 :)
carlos: now, go fix! :)
tell me if that was the correct product/whatever. It's not trivial: the "full list" link does a popup, but it doesn't show anything.
jordi: dude, you have an entry box with a search button ;-)
which shows nothing, no matter what I input
I mean
I try to search for rosetta and the button doesn't appear to do anything. It's as if it didn't do anything.
jordi: it works here...
I typed "rosetta"  and did a submit
and I got:
rosetta
The Rosetta Translation Portal 
hmm
I... I assure you it wsn't working.
I tried 3 times.
URL?
https://launchpad.ubuntu.com/malone/bugs/+product
from there and using (list) link works here
carlos: yeah, I'm saying it works now.
jordi: what changed?
carlos: who knows.
aarrrrggg
I have lost some code because a conflict and I didn't noticied it, baz does NOT works yet as cvs/svn merging conflicts
the dailies do
you can't commit until they resolved
bob2: my version is from last week
bob2: and baz redo
told me about a conflict
but the file didn't had any mark so I thought it was an error on baz
and resolved the conflict and removed the .rej and .orig
and I suppose that I have lost that change
how did you lose code if it didn't have conflict markers?
bob2: because I know that the code was there but it's not now
bob2: a bug in baz?
could be...
the actual file contents diffing is done by the regular diff program, tho...
carlos@frodo ~/Work/dists/launchpad $ baz redo
* linting the source tree
C   lib/canonical/rosetta/scripts/import_from_apt.py
****************************************************
Conflicts created while merging. Please resolve all
conflicts and then run baz resolved --all
****************************************************
carlos@frodo ~/Work/dists/launchpad $ gvim lib/canonical/rosetta/scripts/import_from_apt.py
carlos@frodo ~/Work/dists/launchpad $ baz resolved --all
that's the output
when I saw that the file does not have any >>>> or <<<<
so you merged, got a conflict, resolved it, then commited and the merge was gone?
strings I executed the baz resolved --all 
no
bob2: I did a baz undo
star-merge
hm
commit
baz redo
oh, and the undone code was gone?
and got a conflict (because other local changes I did before remembered the baz undo thing)
oh
bob2: only the part that conflicted 
ok, so, from the begininng:
local edit
other changes remain there
star-merge
undo
star-merge
commit
redo
no, sorry
?
local edit
undo
star-merge
commit
local edit
noticied that my changes are in the undo directory
removed by hand some changes (seems like I forgot some of them)
redo
conflict due some local changes were still there
and I lost the conflict code from the undo directory
hm
oh
redo will not have made <<<<<-style conflict markers
right, the file does not have such markers
right
so if you got conflicts, then deleted the .mod and .orig files, tthen you've lost data :/
bob2: I know :-(
I thought that they were useless
does this sound like what happened?
bob2: yeah
ah
hm
wouldd it make more sense to you if redo produced 3-way-style markers?
bob2: don't know how they look like
the <<<< ones
in the file
yeah
that's what I expected
that's why I removed the .orig and .rej files
right
because usualy the .rej is empty (with a message that you should look at the file)
file a bug asking that redo do that then? :)
yeah
ok
bob2: are you using malone now?
especially now that -t is the default for star-merge, it's confusing that redo does not
erm, I don't know
I know we were going to switch at some point, but I on't know if we did
bob2: it's open to the public atm
so I suppose that it depends on you to use it for bazaar
we are going to use it for Rosetta as soon as I send the announcement tonight
oh, cool
no bugs on bazaar in it yet, I'll wait for robert or brad to tell me it's ready to roll, I think
bob2: brad is on holidays
ah
so is robert
bob2!
Yeah. I don't believe redo isn't doing three way yet.
stub/spiv: around ?
jblack: ?
Yeah? 
jblack: I need to reboot production and devel supermirror - ok?
checking
go ahead
thanks, rebooting
it won't hurt devel if you reboot it whenever you like.
on production, the only thing you need to watch out for is whether or not tla is running
Everything I write is lock safe, but tla itself isn't.
okay, both back
thanks
hey stub. you haven't commited that patch for the preferred email and the temp email table, right?
huh. i wonder if making xserver kick off dpkg-reconfigure on itself when it fails to start is a good idea.
heh.
!!! HACK !!!
how annoying
my laptop will only associate with my AP for about 20 seconds
then it drops
hello :)
any webmaster of ubuntulinux.org, or a way to contact one of theme? didn't get any answer to my mails :/
we're creating a french support site for ubuntu, including a forum, would be nice if there could be a link in http://www.ubuntulinux.org/community/forums/
who did you email?
info & webmaster @ ubuntulinux.org
when?
the first about a month ago, the second about 2 weeks ago
both were about a french site about ubuntu
12/13/2004 07:33 PM
from etheeten@gmail.com
if that could help you :|
that was to trademarks@ubuntulinux.org
the first mail is from 11/30/2004 01:54 AM , to info@ubuntulinux.org, from yann@mandragor.org
does that help? :|
well, do you think I should try to mail again? :/
hm, no cds yet
mako: if the cds claimed to have shipped on nov 8th, but aren't here yet, is it time to start wondering?
wow that is a while
i got mine back at thanksgiving
daniels: my X laptop gets very unhappy when I start a second X server
I still haven't gotten mine either.
CD's that is.
have you checked shipit.ubuntu.com?
how long does it take on average
depends on when you order
they go out in bunches
i orderd them aroung turkey day
and not it finaly told me thay sent them on the 6th of this month
should be there very soon then
bob2, i've the same problem. (same ship date too)
2 weeks
really
wow thats fast specaly since its the x-mas malling seasion
they are shipped from switzerland i think
so probably takes a while
morning
fabbione: hi
morning all
hey doko
doko: we need a 64bit gcc for ppc
fabbione: see on chinstrap:~doko/gcc/
sw33t
why isn't uploaded?
it's C only, we don't a 64bit glibc, no priority, ...
doko: we need the gcc for the 64bit kernel :-)
the rest can wait
doko: we will need a very minimal amount of packages in 64 bit
just buy an x86-64 ;)
like gcc, libc, ncurses and something like sparc-utils
does ubuntu work on g5's already?
calc: our buildd are g5
cool
but they are running UP/32bit
oh
because of kernel limitations
that kinda sucks, wasting half of the system then
is it numa like amd64?
that's why we need gcc 64bit & so on...
no idea...
i am not into ppc at all
oh ok
i just need to prepare the kernel for elmo to test at the datacenter :)
32bit apps on ppc are usually faster.
doko: it is like sparc
32bit is usually faster in general except when you have a braindead arch like x86
64bit kernel, 32 bit userland
and only a few userland packages in 64bit
like pgsql and stuff like that
a 32bit x86-64 would be interesting
i wonder if it would be even faster (if its even possible to force it into such a mode)
installing on 9600bps serial console is the pain
dont suppose anybody who knows much about preseeding base-config is awake
wasabi: just ask
Well.... trying to find the right preseeding values to get hoary's base-config to skip everything.
Tried everything I can and it's still asking for username, passwor,d and showing the welcome and timezone screens
wasabi: preseeding isn't always enough
you need to workaround some debconf priorities as well
Hmmm.
Well, not sure how to adjust the priorities of base-config, which is started automatically.
you need to edit the scripts
the base-config scripts?
yes
nuh.
buh.
that's not easy. =/
i never said it was :)
I was just hoping.
It should be easier.
So, there a howto? ;0
just read the code? ;)
Err:511
Morning
hey pitti
Hi mvo
hi pitti 
hi
Hi seb128 
"seb128 broke my gnome"" ?
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	seb128	morning
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	seb128	(mataro server)
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	seb128	Treenaks: hum ?
2005-01-01T09:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	seb128: why did I have to rm ~/.gnome2/session to make my panel work again? :)
2005-01-01T09:45:00.000Z	seb128	""seb128 broke your panel"
seb128: and nautilus.. I couldn't right-click on the desktop either
Treenaks: killall gnome-vfs-daemon nautilus gnome-panel trashapplet
nothing to do with the session
that's a gnome-vfs-daemon bug
seb128: removing the session fixed it for me
no
restarting fixed it
no ?
the bug doesn't happen every time
seb128: no, I tried to log in 3 times -- each time the panel "hung".. removing the session file -> it worked again
seb128: so that was a coincidence?
yep
you have kept the session ?
I moved it aside instead of rm'ing it, so yes
not that I used it for anything but starting gaim.. but hey
you can retry to put it again and see if it bugs
tonight, when I'm with the machine again :)
ok
if the session is broken open a bug with it :)
brrr
-9C according to my weather
at least now it feels like december :)
8)
daniels: ping
Kamion: already awake?
Keybuk: here?
pitti: apparently you are the only one working here :p
pitti: daniels is in vac...
yes, I remembered about daniels as soon as I hit enter :-/
I need a native English speaker to review an USN text
pitti: how can I train pmount to not sync mount certain volumes in warty? i.e. external HDs
mvo: upgrade to hal/pmount/gvm of Hoary :-)
mvo: seriously, this is not trivial in Warty
mvo: the easiest solution is probably to add an fstab entry
pitti: aye, thanks#
gosh, all channels are so quiet today - it almost feels like it was christmas, or so...
heh
I can make some noise if you want :p
lalalalala
lololo
let's sing a christmas song
;)
hehe
Frhliche Weihnacht berall 
*shudder*
lalalalalala la lala
Treenaks: come on, now a dutch one !
yay

lalala
*bathes
hum
and now
/usr/bin/env: python: No such file or directory
(running dput)
seb128: if it gives you a better feeling, my python XML support is gone, too
:(
Mithrandir: ping
doko: did you realize that you uploaded gcc3.4 as native package?
no
nevermind
i am on crack
pitti: yo
Kamion: i did bootstrap the sparc :-)
cool
plenty of problems, but nothing unfixable
for some reasons d-i installed a -smp kernel (=kabuum)
that's easy to sort out
and it didn't find silo-installer or couldn't install silo for some reasons
and it did add restricted to sources.list
that's another kabuum
probably 2 of them are related
not really interested in kludging the restricted thing for sparc only; fix your archive :)
Kamion: well... there is nothing restricted for sparc...
for the rest, can you send me /var/log/debian-installer/syslog from the installed system?
but yeah...
i will fix my archive
sure, but d-i doesn't get to know that
sure i can
the silo thing is weird
it might be something wrong on the archive... i didn't spend too much time on it
oh, *crap*, silo-installer is RETARDED
ok, that's silo-installer brokenness which needs to be fixed
Kamion: oh.. ok
unfortunately it means a string change
Kamion: hmmm
it might be easier to kludge it by unexcluding silo from debootstrap for now
Kamion: no rush....
it is more important to get the correct kernel
at least in the beginning
fabbione: what does the 'ncpus probed' line in /proc/cpuinfo look like?
ncpus probed    : 1
this is with 2.6.8 from debian
fabbione: hm, is linux-sparc64 in your archive?
it's in restricted ... :)
Kamion: the most important thing is that i need to figure why the console hangs at the end of the boot process
isn't that from linux-meta?
actually it might not be in restricted, haven't checked
yes
bob2: yeah, it may be a problem.. i am making a list of probably borked cds
bob2: shipments that is.. i'll be contacting the companya bout them
linux-sparc64_2.6.9-4_sparc.deb
bob2: i have a half a dozen now
Kamion: i get this in main
hm
/var/log/debian-installer/syslog definitely needed to debug
i did send you the mail....
did you get it?
haven't read mail yet this morning
ah ok
take your time
i need to go and cut my hairs
+ the buildd is catching up
all that lsb-* is crap on console :-)
it looks really really really hugly
doko: here ?
waaaah
wasabi: you know that the username/password stuff is in shadow not base-config, right?
i can't even get the welcoem screen to go away.
but no, i didn't.
# Avoid the introductory message.
base-config     base-config/intro       note
does that not work?
i have that, and no.
# Skip the two initial welcome screens.
base-config     base-config/title       title
base-config     base-config/intro       note
base-config     base-config/login       note
i've got those.
s/two/three
heh
s/two// =/
title isn't a question anyway
yeah i just saw it in debconf-get-selections and figured i'd give it a try
would probably be easiest to figure out how to get base-config's debconf priority to critical
so the passwd stuff is shadow now, not passwd?
the manual says passwd.
might require adding a base-config/priority template for preseeding; I was ordered to stop Ubuntu copying debconf/priority from the first stage
or something does, or i wouldn't have done it.
passwd is from the shadow source package; sure, passwd
i dont know enough about templates and stuff yet.
im just a user trying to deploy ubuntu today
I'm at least partially talking to myself ... :)
if i can get this working, fai is going to die an ugly death
because i like this much better.
ok, how about I add base-config/priority for you now in 2.60ubuntu4
for obvious reasons.
sounds good!
Yeah I like the idea of having a seperate setting for base-config
could be useful in certain circumstances.
morning
jdub: can I add silo to base for sparc?
Kamion: are you making that change now or later? just wondering so I can stop paying attention tonight.
fabbione: aha, you and ia64 share a bug, found it and am fixing now
wasabi: right after this fix for Fabio
you dont' have to worry about it
I think it's important though
oh okay. ;)
lamont: tomorrow's CD should fix the ia64 kernel brokenness
(in d-i)
wasabi: uploaded. when you see base-config_2.60ubuntu4_all.deb in the archive, try 'base-config base-config/priority select critical'
super. You rock.
thank you drive thru
untested though :)
fun
Kamion: is the hoary i386-cdimage of today safe to use? 
mvo: no idea, probably not
mvo: it includes python2.4-minimal and so needs a debootstrap update, which I'm doing now
is there a date that you can recommend :) ?
20041220 would be my first guess but I haven't tried it
ah, thanks
I'll give it a try then. I need a current cd to test upgrading from it 
Kamion: cool.. what was the bug?
whoops :-)
i can see from the changes ;)
fabbione: is there a ppc or i386 dchroot somewhere with kernel build-deps?
yup
ppc davis
cool, thanks
fabbione: i386 somewhere?
i386.. hmm probably macaroni
otherwise send me the diff and i will build it for you
fabbione: I don't need a full build to start with; I will probably trim down the .config for my host and test there
fabbione: I would like to start with the PaX kernel
pitti: ah i see
good luck :-)
fabbione: thanks!
fabbione: btw, SSP really rocks
pitti: eheheh
you are a security bitch
fabbione: basically, with SSP you can forget about buffer overflow USNs
yeah i was there for you taking notes man
I know
Why don't we chroot X?
but now I saw it in action
and digged through the theory
fabbione: it seems that I don't have access to macaroni
pitti: you need to talk with elmo
fabbione: anyway, let's start with ppc then
fabbione: I do when he returns
otherwise send me the stuff i will build here
stupid pile of shit deliberately throws away all errors generated about the .changes
Kamion: priority looks good... somehow I can't find the choice to get past the tiemzone. Asking for the Eastern, Central, etc.
base-config     tzconfig/choose_contry_zone/US  select  Central
you've misspelled country there
HAHA
ohh geeze
heh. im at work now... been doing server upgrades all night
I've been awake 24 hours. Forgive me.
np :)
hi
the kernel package is insane
i am not sure i want to redo it from scratch
seb128: you broke the panel again!!!
seb128: I get bombarded with neverending error dialogs
seb128: :-)
arf
okay this is silly.  and I have no idea how to resolve the problem.  gnome doesnt load and all that is shown is the panel position ( left blank ) and the desktops background colour ( not image )
AndyFitz: apparently logging in a few times fixes it
I thought it was gconfd  because even on new user accounts it happens
no then it's gnome-vfs-daemon
sorry ill move this to #ubuntu
AndyFitz: no, just poke seb128 :)
killall gnome-vfs-daemon nautilus gnome-panel trashapplet
I've gone as far as to create new user acounts and also to completely reinstall gnome entirely
seb128: it must be gnome-session  
because I can load xfce4 fine 
AndyFitz, hey
and from there 'sometimes'  I can loat gnome-panel  
hiya usual
AndyFitz, havn't seen ya in a while on gaim.
doh I got a new screenname, maybe thats why
usual, I've been online on jabber icq irc aol msn etc etc 
AndyFitz, yea, I forgot I changed my screenname
AndyFitz, hows it goin
good but something broke my gnome :P
what happens?
see above
ahh
AndyFitz, are your panels there but blank?
yep
but only sometimes
I think if I've uses sudo recently they seem to work   although I'm not sure
AndyFitz, it happened to me too yesterday and the day before, but it seems fine now
uses = used 
AndyFitz, I nuked the .hastodowithgnomedir's and it seemed to have helped
I already tried nuking them
the problem came back
:(
it was fixed for one login 
AndyFitz, hows the icon set coming btw
looks good
usual, thanks I'm reworking them to suit  brisgeek.com/etiquette/
AndyFitz, full set for gnome?
andy.fitzsimon.com.au/etiquette-icons.tar.gz  is there but very incomplete
AndyFitz, I came across your site for it the other day on gnome-look.org, I like it all but the metacity theme
usual:  theres over 2,000 icons in whats considered a full set for gnome :-/  and I keep changing styles / xml rules 
ah
the metacity theme I have in the gimp screenshot ? 
its also here http://andy.fitzsimon.com.au/icons.png 
pitti: pong :)
the hover state for the buttons shows their type
yea, it looks alot better in thie shot
AndyFitz, can't wait to give them a try
nice trashcan
roberTO did that for the milk gtk theme  I really like it yeah but was going to make my own pixmap based gtk theme first before considering what metacity to use
k
usual, download and check them out now ,  I'm currently using them at 16x16 on my gnome-panel, they were designed to scale below my other stuff
AndyFitz, are they avilible somewhere
andy.fitzsimon.com.au/etiquette-icons.tar.gz
should work
bob2: the BenH patch doesn't even compile
got em
arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cache.S: Assembler messages:
arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cache.S:49: Error: Unrecognized opcode: `dssall'
arch/ppc/platforms/pmac_cache.S:167: Error: Unrecognized opcode: `dssall'
bum
the default size is 48x48 like normal pixmap icons.   lila, gartoon and the industrial gnome-vfs icons  are all 92x92 I think
that's odd, it compiled fine for me
AndyFitz, wierd, I put them in the icon folder, it shows the icon in the theme app, but no icons changed
hey, is hoary working enough now that its worth upgrading to?
robtaylor, I use it daily with little trouble
usual: cool, upgrade it is then ;)
Kamion: i am using -7.diff on davis...
usual: that happens sometimes with gnome-themes-manager ,  next login they will work
ok
brb
fabbione: which flavour is failing?
power3
at least...
DSSALL is used in other places in arch/ppc/
this is the first one that gets to build
yes i know.. but they don't get compiled on power3 apparently
best ask benh I suspect
ping doko
yeah.. they don't get compiled
probably is just an ifdef somewhere
elmo_away: please sync groff 1.18.1.1-5 from Debian
Kamion: sorry for the groff upload; I worked through a modem yesterday and didn't bother to check sid again
np
Kamion: can you confirm that the patch is used only by power4 ?
fabbione: deny
power4 != G4
(for what is my understanding of ppc arch anyway)
I don't know if it should be used only by the powerpc flavours; it contains a number of other updates beyond just sleep so I'd be wary of making that assumption
Kamion: how can i identify that via CONFIG_* in the kernel?
don't try, ask benh to fix it :)
Kamion: the other changes are more generic
I know
and they compile (therefor they can be shipped) on all the other arches
;)
so it compiles, it ... ?
CONFIG_6xx is the kernel used on most powerpc systems, including G4 laptops
G5 systems are CONFIG_POWER4
I would imagine we'll see PowerBook G5 systems in a year or two
hopefully in one year or two all this extra patching won't be required 
it looks like that only power3 doesn't have that DSSALL
fabbione: where's DSSALL defined?
Kamion: ENOCLUE
it looks like something in binutils
grep doesn't return anything useful
anyone know of squeak packages for ubuntu?
or, even squeak for debian that i could recompile?
squeak?
Simira: same one, or cooler one? :P)
squeak, Treenaks 
smalltalk environment
Treenaks: cooler, of course. The old one isn't in sale anymore
grrrr.
need /etc/apt/sources.list.d
srbaker: submit a patch
Treenaks, i intend to as soon as i move
it's on my tomboy list :P
speaking of which, i need hoary packages for f-spot and tomboy.
anyone know?
srbaker: there is a patch in the bts for /etc/apt/sources.list.d. we'll get it eventually :)
okay.  so now the only thing i need to increase my productivity is moisturizing cream that doesn't make my hands feel greasy
srbaker: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=66325
cool
carlos: had time to look at accessd yet??
pitti: would you like to take a look?
robtaylor: I'm in a bit of a hurry right now
robtaylor: but in general I'd like to look at it
Keybuk: signkey uses "$name's" in a couple of places, which in Perl is the same as $name::s
Keybuk: care to fix that to ${name}'s?
robtaylor: is there a tarball/pdf/whatever to look at?
pitti: no rush, but when you're not busy let me know and i'll take you through it
robtaylor: a guided tour? That'll be nice! :-)
Keybuk: (or $name\'s)
pitti: http://sourcecontrol.net/~rtaylor/ has accessd and dbus packages with extra python bindings
s/accessd/my accessd arch repo mirror/
how do i completely disable OSS?
Hi trulux
trulux: I tried your ssp packages. Rock!
trulux: it is really cool
trulux: to actually put it into Hoary, I'd like to see two things:
trulux: 1) rename the packages to *-ssp
trulux: 2) modify the gcc-ssp-3.4 wrapper program to include the necessary settings (-lssp and -fstack-protector)
trulux: otherwise I played around with it a little, looks nice
Kamion: you around?
hey pitti
seb128: around?
lamont: yep
pitti, why the name change? nothing is different (in usability terms)
what's this total python b0rkage?
/bin/sh: /usr/bin/mklibs: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
the warpper is (almost) ready
what's up with archive.u.c?
just needs packaging
trulux: because we already have such a source and binary package? (and, btw, a newer one)
pitti, i can send you the patches
in order to get the stuff without pain in newerr versions
trulux: we can't just drop something straight into hoary without seeing how it works elsewhere first
what do you think?
a separate package for the meantime is extremely useful.
otherwise you're asking a great deal of faith from us
trulux: and it would be cool to integrate -lssp and -fstack-protector into the wrapper, so that these do not need to be specified explicitly
pitti, that could be done in an easy way
trulux: the plan is to have completely separate packages for a while
trulux: and when they prove good and we are reasonable sure to 1) not break anything and 2) we have a chance of sustainable support, then we can talk about putting them into main
trulux: oh: and gcc-ssp packages should depend on libssp-dev
pitti, yes
trulux: thanks! see you later
pitti, i will send you the patches
Kamion, anyway, i did the stuff in the way i thought it's the best
and non-enabled by default is the best way
i must go too
is it possible to comppletely disable OSS?
hi
yann__: if you find them, tell me how you did it :)
yann__: I might need it for the Dutch site :)
didn't they answer to your emails either ? 
Treenaks  > let's see your website :)
yann__: www.ubuntulinux.nl and www.ubuntu-linux.nl (run by the same guy, need to be integrated)
hello
is this the right channel to discuss rosetta ?
tim1: theres a rosetta chaneel :)
tim1: join #rosetta
Kamion, elmo_away: so theoretically, there is a community council meetining today, right?
Kamion: apparently, it will be just me and you
mako: also wondered about that :)
elmo seems away and sabdfl as well
well, there a couple country teams on the agenda
and one more i suspect if sivang has anything to do with it
mako : yes :)
elmo is away
lamont: do you know about sabdfl?
smurfix: you around?
well, at least I'm here :)
no clue, but wouldn't surprise me, given his 'take some down time' comments at the conf
i'm trying to decide if we have can go ahead with the meeting
lamont: do you know elmo's story
lamont: basically, will he be back in 1.25h?
doko!!
Treenaks  > www.ubuntu-fr.org
:)
mako: dunno.  ISTR him saying something about a week of holiday right after the conf
hmm.. ok
well.. i can call mark and see if he's gonna be around at all this week
otherwise, this stuff will be put off until at least after new years
Kamion: it may be our chance to ram through otherwise controverisal proposal
mako: I reckon most people need some time off after the conference, we could probably manage with only some brief discussions for country teams and others..
Treenaks > how many mails did you sent? is it worth trying again? :)
yann__: none yet, because the merging isn't done yet
we've got a forum that's already open, the site is comnig soon... but still can't get in touch with ubuntu's team
enrico: hi!
sivang: hi!
mako: hmm. does two out of four count as a majority?
mako: yep, just came home
is Jane still on holiday?
mako: elmo said he'd be away from tomorrow, which I took to mean that he'd be here today
well, mark will l come
i just talked to him on the phone
ah, ok
hmm, hal is working today.  yesterday it refused to play, today I get an "IAUDIO" window popping up.  strange thing, I think my camera actually kills it
mako: 
smurfix: want to prepare a short thing about country teams goals and such to present at the meeting
smurfix: i'm going to prepare a short summary from the nm bof
mako: I'll be at the meeting
smurfix: awesome.. i'll put an introduction on the agneda
mako: are you going to discuss the NM process on the CC meeting?
when is the meeting?
OK, I'll say a few words about country team stuff then
zul: 1600 UTC
\o/
smurfix: k thanks
haggai: my understanding is that Jane is still on holiday.  she is checking email occasionally, apparently
how long do these meetings take, usually?
Treenaks: hmm, that depends :)
minutes, hours, days, weeks
Treenaks: there have been ones that took more then 2 hours :)
sivang: I've heard of 5-minute ones
Treenaks: there have beem, well, TB meetings tend to take much much longer.
shortest has been 15 minutes IIRC
my boss won't like a >1hr one (closing down the building, setting the alarm and stuff :))
Treenaks: tell your boss to be patient :)
zul: 8)
sivang: i'd like to 
lamont: thanks :)
are there any NM's for the meeting that need CC approval
haggai: did we approve you yet?
or do we need to?
mako: yup, I'm all done
good
mako: NMs or "ubuntites"? 
there were a handful of people that raised their hand at the NM meeting
Treenaks: sorry, "UBUNTITES"
mako: I was one of those :)
we can add you to the list
OK, great
Treenaks: actually, go add yourself :)
CommunityCouncilAgenda
mako: hm, need to hack together a wiki page on myself then :)
probably
mako: development maintainers needs be approved by technical contribs right?
sivang: by the tech board
Kamion: ah ok :)
mako: Did you find a chance to review the NM draft?
ChrisH: sure.. it will have to be super quick
mako: next time write "smurf" instead of misspelling my name please ;-)
mako: could you reminde me what being an UBUNTITES mean? :)
i spelled it right once and then mispelled it when i lost my change, i swear :)
fabbione: you around?
sivang: basically you can vote and such but not upload packages
sivang: i think you should put yourself down for that
people with visible contributions to the community who want to be enfranchised
mako: ok, I'll go list my name there - already have a page :)
mako: but there is not "new ubuntites" page :)
sivang: 1 second
well, make one, it's a wiki after all :)
ok, let's rock it on! (as jdub says )
there's an entry on the agenda page now
sivang: edit now :)
Treenaks: done:)
mako: what about doc maintainership? is it the same like being a ubuntites?
sivang: yes
Kamion: i want that patch
currently it's too horrible for words and hardcodes my key ... :)
Kamion: package it up when you fix that :)
(well, keyid, anyway)
Kamion: So use $ENV{SIGN_KEYID} and complain if that's not set ;-)
can some ppl here confirm this bug for me: (not sure my mistake or bug)
I have a error msg in synaptic each time I update
[Invalid UTF-8]  Could not parse file '/usr/share/applications/ooo645calc.desktop':
desktop entry contain line 'Comment[ca] =Fulla de c\xc3| lcul d'OpenOffice.org' which is not UTF-8
mojo: it's a known issue
wow, if this is a place to report bugs, i got a bug in gthumb (warty) :)
yann__: bugzilla.ubuntu.com
Mithrandir > i know, i know :|
ok i'll try.
thx for the info, at least I know it's not my mistake
lamont: now
Kamion: the ibook thingy can compile only on 6xx
so powerpc kernels
ok
smurfix: ping
fabbione: will the next kernel build system include an animated colorful cartoon strip to make it more interesting?
sivang: 
smurfix: that in jap or chineese?
:)
smurfix: anyway, we still don't have an ubuntu-il mailing list :)
sivang: That's "pong".
smurfix: also, do we already have anything for making derived distros wrt to locality?
smurfix: in what lang? :)
sivang: Chinese of course.
sivang: I dunno wo's responsible for the mailing lists, I just know it's not me ;-)
who's
sivang: easily making derived distros is on the agends for post-hoary.
sigh, need to add python-minimal to debootstrap as well as python2.4-minimal now ...
has anyone noticed problems with the security update login package in warty?
google and gmane say no
tseng: no, what do you mean?
Hi elmo
booting it gives me a big dump of cant execute /sbin/agetty
elmo: Mark asked me to rename debstriptranslations to pkgstriptranslations
then it respawns to fast, and init gives up completely
elmo: I guess that means that debstriptranslations will be removed and I upload a new package pktstriptranslations?
tseng: This is not a login problem
pitti: just upload the new package for now
tseng: this rather sounds like the udev race condition
preferably soon, as I'm on holiday from tomorrow on
pitti: oh =/
elmo: okay, I'll do
tseng: sometimes the text consoles just say byebye
tseng: BTW, we did not make a security update of 'login'. What do you mean in particular?
fabbione: hrm, ok
well i did a clean install of warty, then dist-upgrade from security, universe, and main
and it grabbed a new login
elmo: could you sync groff 1.18.1.1-5 from Debian please?
pitti: sorry its a bit hard to report better, as its not finishing init
Kamion: done
thanks
fabbione: the silo-installer/silo thing is fixed in d-i svn
elmo: I uploaded pkgstriptranslations.
pitti: i found my bug.. inittab is all wrong
tseng: ugh, did you modify it or is it wrong by default?
i didnt modify it, not sure how it got this way
will one from hoary do?
tseng: what's wrong with the inittab?
its calling /sbin/agetty
and /sbin/rc
which dont even exist
i think someone copied over it
tseng: I doubt that inittab says agetty by default
tseng: this would have breaked on each and every installation
yeah someone was f'ing with it
i appologize
tseng: no worries :-)
tseng: were you able to restore it?
tseng: I can send you the default version if necessary
yes, but im totally baffled as to who wouldve copied another distros inittab over this one
heh, i have one here now that i know what is up
Kamion: I'm beginning to think grub and scrubbing disks REALLY don't agree
elmo: hmm?
I just got that stupid grub failure when reinstalling  a DL380
then again, lilo doesn't work either.  meh.
scrubbing disks?
today sucks.
kamion: when you first create a RAID array and it syncs thems
it would probably be good for me to learn something about RAID, wouldn't it?
yeah, I'm getting exactly the same error as on the Dell's
in that bug-from-hell
is that the HPT370 one?
nah
one sec
locales suck
hmm, I closed the bug.  go me.
it's your birthday.
elmo: did you see my note about bittorrent tracker?
maswan: the port thing?
elmo: yeah
maswan: yeah, thanks
Kamion: 2211
elmo: same failure mode as at the start of that bug?
right
gar, and it's going take eons to scrub half a fricking terabyte
can you arrange to add the debug command to grub-installer's grub invocation?
or even run the grub commands by hand in the grub shell
dump (hd0,0)/boot/grub/stage1 /tmp/grbdfsbdfsgaz is failing
with "file not found"
anyone need anything before I run?
oh. elmo's here. cool
Kamion: there's some strace's in p.u.c/~james that mdz and I looked at before, there's very little difference between working and broken; I'll try and get some more tho
grub straces are depressingly uninformative sometimes :(
as mdz said in the bug, it looks like working-strace was when booted from the hard disk?
right
yay for pax!
elmo: I'm kind of way out of ideas :-(
tseng: it fends off the buffer overflow exploit as well as SSP
pitti: im very familiar with pax
tseng: what do you think, is either one (ssp/pax) already enough or should we strive to get both?
pitti: well, both is ideal
because pax has 0 protection against ret2libc
well, not 0, just adds security-by-obscurity
tseng: I will put a PaX enabled kernel into universe when I finished the porting to 2.6.9
oh wow
Kamion: no prob - can you remind me the equivalent of grub-installer for lilo tho?  I need at least one bootloader on this thing :)
tseng: do you happen to know somebody who already did that
pitti: yes
tseng: s//?/
the author
tseng: on the hp there is only a patch for 2.6.7
yes
elmo: lilo-installer
elmo: lilo-installer?
argh ;)
anna should install it by default
tseng: the rejections are not bad, but cause a bit of work
hmm, no lilo in the base system atm
I guess the "Install lilo" step is spassing out real early
elmo: doesn't need to be, lilo-installer will apt-install it as needed
oh
if it's used
eh, sorry, to be stupid, but you're saying I should be able to just run 'lilo-installer' from shell?
no - are you in the d-i environment?
yes
back up to the main menu and select the menu item to install lilo
elmo: *cough*sparc*cough* are you having some fun at the dc?
I tried that
you can try udpkg --configure lilo-installer too
it just says an error occured, and there's nothing helpful on the log tailing screen
what file is that thing tailing?
tty3 tails /var/log/messages, tty4 tails /var/log/syslog
/bin/sh: /usr/bin/apt-listchanges: /usr/bin/python: bad interpreter: No such file or directory

sweeet
fixed in new python-defaults
or install python-minimal
Kamion: ok, so it's just saying lilo-installer exited with status 1, meh
elmo: stick 'set -x' at the top of the postinst
Kamion: probably getting that in this upgrade
LOL
it's looking for part156378345346
welcome to d-i debugging
wow
(or so)
Kamion: do the final releases have "Unofficial" in the README.diskdefines ?
can you see what bootfs_devfs and bootfs are being set to?
this'd be so much easier if we had wireless in here and I could do this without the to-fro
Errors were encountered while processing:
linda
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
heh
elmo: no
that'd be linda wanting python ...
ah, okay, maybe I should start from the beginning and burn a fresh CD then
well, I dunno what'd have been fixed, but I suppose it can't hurt to try ...
elmo: where's the line with Unofficial?
DISKNAME says "Unofficial binary-i386" in it at the end
fabbione: :(
#define DISKNAME  Ubuntu 4.10 "Warty Warthog" - Preview i386 Binary-1
this is just a CD which I had lieing around, it could date back to like, June.. 
elmo: good luck.. 
I can't even remember when I removed Unofficial; certainly before the preview, but I'm not sure when
ok, trashing and burning fresh from releases.u.c
pitti: ping?
Automatically selecting en_GB.UTF-8 locale in addition to en_GB.
that text look OK?
hi :)
any suggestions for how to record that /etc/locale.gen has been migrated to UTF-8? if the user later removes the UTF-8 locales, that choice should be respected
someone when the mono-assemblies-arch and mono-assemblies-base 1.04-1 will be available ?
(one the hoary repositories)
beucause impossible to use any mono package until then :/
(especially monodevelop)
mono apps work for me.
mmh... when have you updated the packages for the last time ? :/
try to update or reinstall monodevelop and you will see :(
everything is broken because these two package are not here
mmh they are here but in version 1.0.2-1 while mono-jit asks for 1.0.4-1
:/
from archive.ubuntu.com?
yes
no such problem here.
?
I update my apt-get each day to see if there is a fix...
but didn't see it :(
(in hoary)
fabbione: please shout when you're done with davis
anyone else got some tips for how to mount my digital camera?
Simira: what kind of cam is it
Canon powershot
Kamion: doh, same error with fresh CD, meh
open wifi aps make baby jesus happy
Treenaks: : you had a suggestion, or you just wanted to know about my new cam?
Simira: canon powershot?
Simira: open gthumb, file -> import photos
Simira: it'll be detected automagically
Simira: doent it getmounted automatically ?
+s
ogra: powershots use PTP.. they're not mass-storage :(
hum
*tries*
Treenaks: bah....
I like the cam, though
Treenaks: i love my ole olympus
Simira: which one? the A85?
ogra: Good Ole'ympus ;)
no, only an A400. A little bit better than the old one.
*g*
Simira: you've seen mine right? that's a A75
Simira: was yours insured ?
yes, it was
wow, lucky girl;)
well, not the cam, but my travel insurance covered it
ogra: mine is ;)
I'm doing 100M/day on it 8)
probably there should be a place to upload for all the ppl that can not pay for the traffic.....
Treenaks: looks similar for mine
it won't detect my camera :-/
but there were loads of ppl taking pictures.....
bob2 hasn't put up his, and Tollef. And Mako. Among others
bob2 should :)
is there a way the xorg config could be done by xorg itself? without a user input, or i've to run the old mkxf86config?
Simira: I've seen tollef's pics..
Simira: or at least some of those
yep
amu: dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ?
hm
*grumble*
Simira: i won't until i get home
Simira: yep....he has made a really beutiful one of me in the bar
:) hehe
+a
amu: otherwise: "dexconf"
hm... but I still can't get my camera on Ubuntu... hrmf
Simira: it's not detected by gthumb?
Simira: it should be in "play" mode, otherwise it won't be detected
(if it's like mine)
Treenaks: it works also if there's no debconf data? need it for the livecd
hm, ok
yay
it worked
hmm, yesterday i saw daniels saying that the detection stuff is done by xorg itself.....probably he changed something
mako: you're still stuck in Spain???
Simira: stuck is perhaps not the best term
ah, Daniels also took a lot of picks
Simira: i'm in valencia staying with jordi
heh
ogra: good question, daniels is away
mako: so, holiday-vacationing, eh?
amu: i heard he is on holiday now....
tseng: guess what? the whole grsecurity patch applies cleanly against the patched Ubuntu kernel source :-)
pitti: wonderful, i had a feeling it would
im using it in a pretty big patchset myself
tseng: the back of my head always reminded me about long-winded discussions in Debian about the non-applicability to Debian kernels...
fabbione: around and have a minute?
tseng: oops, there are two rejections
yay!
got my cd's just now
wow this are slick
re
elmo: ANYTIME!
elmo: next time don't wait for me... just kick me out :-)
pitti: yeah
fabbione: don't worry there's no rush, I'm probably only half way through
elmo: it's 100% your :-)
i was only doing a test compilation
nothing really too seriuos... just the ibookg4sleep1337patch
in the worst case i will tell ppc users to blame GTK
lol
heh
pitti: PONG!
pitti: DING DONG DANG!
fabbione: sorry, still at the phone
Description:
Remote exploit for IPSwitch WS_FTP version 5.03 that binds a shell to port 4444.
CUTE!
morning
fabbione: back
pitti: thanks for doing those libssp packages :)
fabbione: is there an easy way to provide a hacked kernel image (with new deb names) without duplicating the linux-source source package?
pitti: yo
ajmitch_: no problem, easy package
pitti: build-dep on linux-source-2.6.9
pitti: what will be harder is if we try & get selinux in, and enabled by default
pitti: the one that gives you the tar.bz2 in /usr/src
pitti: but i don't recall if it has patches or not.. you will have to check on that
fabbione: basically I want to use all the Ubuntu patches, add one, change the configuration and the deb names
in case... you have linux-patches something
pitti: yup... i got that
pitti: you still need the same build-deps
fabbione: okay, I will play around with that
fabbione: basically I would need a binary package that ships the source's dpatches
no.. you just need to ship your patch
all the others are in the source or -linux-patch
hi there
pitti, woo woo!
:)
hi trulux 
fabbione: ah, cool
hi trulux 
check all the pkgs.. there is everything you need
the only thing i am not sure we ship are the config
in that case i will provide them for you.. no big deal for that
hey ajmitch_
ajmitch_, i think we cantry to write a little schedule for the SELinux work
fabbione: I need to change the config anyway; patching yours would be nice, but just copy&change is fine by now
trulux: sure
pitti: ok.. i will tell you some little secrets about configs tomorrow.. i am watching a movie now ;)
fabbione: oh, then I won't disturb you further
fabbione: enjoy! :-)
pitti: thanks man
have a good night
night!
fabbione: have fun :)
'n
oups
'night
ajmitch_, fine
ajmitch_, why not start a page named SELinux on Debian at the hardened debian wiki
?
go ahead :)
heh
let me start a draft
trulux: btw, I'm currently at porting the grsecurity patch to the Ubuntu kernel
pitti, did you noticed that 2.0.3 is for 2.6.9??
it's a spender's test patch
trulux: yup, that's the one I use
ok
I don't think that grsecurity & selinux will work in the same kernel at all :)
you'd need to choose between them
ajmitch_: not at the same time
pitti, don't use it by now
ajmitch_: but at least I like grsecurity much more than SELinux, so I'm happy :-)
ajmitch_, err, it depends on how the hooks are used and implemented
ajmitch_, we are strange guys here ... don't get sad by this, grsec is much more usable :(
but does a diff thing anyway
iirc grsec may even patch out the LSM hooks from the kernel
ajmitch_: in theory you _could_ have two chained MAC systems, though :-)
ajmitch_: and grsec does not use LSM
only if you were brave and/or stupid :)
I know that
but I mean that grsec explicitly disables the functionality that selinux uses
ajmitch_: I don't know whether it would work, and I don't really care
ajmitch_: actually I mostly care for PaX
it doesn't help that the grsec dev is rather disagreeable ;)
ajmitch_: but since grsecurity applies reasonably well to our kernel, why not take the full patch :-)
selinux is already enabled in upstream debian kernels, packages are in sid
ajmitch_: the default Ubuntu kernel is also compiled with SELInux (but not enabled)
ajmitch_: same as in Sid
as long as you're just wanting to have another kernel :)
ajmitch_: right now this is not intended to replace our default kernel anyway :-)
ajmitch_: right now it will become an additional kernel in universe, for people wanting PaX
iirc gentoo people had PaX & selinux working together
ajmitch_: yes, this should be entirely possible
pitti, i have the selinux hooks for pax
will be inside my backport
which stills is in really panic-state
(that one which means nothing even compiles without brainfucking and so on)
So I suspose my next step is going to be building a kerberos 5 .udeb.
And d-i piece.
pitti, btw, what about the gcc patches?
trulux: will look at them; right now I still have your packages installed
ok, fine
hi
can someone do me a favour and try logging into the website?
elmo, hey
elmo: yes
elmo, did you noticed my enhyancement report to the bugzilla?
trulux: the binutils thing?
pitti: yes, it works or yes, you can try? :)
elmo: works for me
pitti, we need to have elmo including my PT_PAX_FLAGS stuff inside binutils for having good PaX support
elmo: now both
(soft mode)
pitti: excellent
elmo, yes
pitti: for your next trick, can you try rosetta?
elmo: sure
have there been any sound related changes to hoary recently ? just did a apt-get upgrade and have a completely sound-free system running now hehe.. ( sorry to bug the dev channel but the general channel is mostly clueless.. )
elmo: "You are logged in"
elmo: works
pitti: sweet, thanks
trulux: hmm, right now I use the legacy ELF header marking
trulux: this is way less intrusive
i get silence from whatever player i try - no error messages tho.. and nothing seems to be muted according to alsamixer
trulux: sorry, I won't have a chance to look at that till after Christmas - I'm busy in the data centre right now, and on holiday after that
gilligan_: is esd still running
gilligan_: ?
gilligan_: and check in gstreamer-properties that esd is used
esd running
.. /usr/bin/esd -nobeeps
gilligan_: check whether your mixer now has a "DRC" setting which is low
pitti: DRC seems to be off
and DRC Range = 0
gilligan_: can you enable it? This DRC thingy bite me a while ago
hum.wonder how ;)
elmo, data center?
esd is set to input & output in gstreamer preferences btw
trulux: working on our machines
elmo, we are looking for someone to support us giving a development machine
sponsoring
because we are running on a bit bad-organized network, without a main development center
elmo there are a lot ppl on #ubuntu, ust trying rosetta
elmo: ah.. DRC was it..
gilligan_: works now?
elmo: now i get super-crappy sound but i guess i just have to play around with the mixer a bit
elmo: thanks
ogra: when I rebooted it?  sweet :(
hmm... some are a little upset....
gilligan_: I had this crappy and silent sound, too; for me it helped to set DRC to about 75%
saving while rebooting.....hm
pitti: "DRC" or "DRC Range" ? my "DRC" is still off .. "DRC Range" is set to 75
gilligan_: don't know exactly
did apt get borked in hoary?  I keep getting "W: GPG error: http://archive.ubuntu.com hoary Release: Unknown error executing gpgv" everytime I do apt-get update.  normal channel doesn't have help to offer.  Any idea where to look for the error text?
trulux: so what will you try & push? grsec or selinux?
grsec as soft option
selinux for the big guys ;D
soft option?
ironwolf: ping mvo tomorrow; he recently introduced signature verification in apt
yes, the easiest to deploy one
do you find selinux hard to deploy?
ajmitch_, not until we get it in the right way
it's a MAC system with TE and so on, it's more difficult to deployt than simple grsec
ajmitch_: one big problem is that selinux requires a bunch of patched base packages, which grsec doesn't
pitti: as long as you don't have to maintain the patches it's ok :)
especially if the patches get merged upstream
hi
hi
hey sid77 
hey, how are you?
hello.  Someone remembers what was in the HowTo wiki page before it messed up?
hmm
how to write howtos? or docs?
someone remembers of an HOWTO index?
I remember..but it vanished right?
right.  Do you remember it had a long list of items?
I just want to make that sure
yes, I do.
it was horroble to navigate, but it was there..
allright
sivang: thanks!
enrico: hey, I didn't do antyhing :)
hi everybody - updating Wifi Howtos, anyone around who understands WiFi?
ftwig: i can try
ta - http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/helpcenterhowto.2004-10-07.7773155363/ is what vI am changing.
I have just added an intor para at the top - have a look
ftwig: ok
Wahts with the stuff about changing the kernel module - it it nessesery - its going to confuse the hell out of newbies.
good - so my understanding is correct.
well the kernel thing is necessary
so the out of the box one douse not support ndiswrapper
/topic anyone?
hey seb128 
afternoon
hi seb
hi sabdfl :)
evening sivang
hi sabdfl 
ready for today's cc meeting?
let's give everyone a few minutes to get together
whoa
hey mako
sabdfl: hey
here
not sure we're getting elmo today
done
hi kamion, saw those uploads this morning
should we get going?
smurfix, you around?
yep
and perhaps to ratify it if that's something we need to do
the agenda suggests smurfix will intro the country-teams idea
smurfix: happy to do so? if so, go ahead
ok
wait one second
(still typing slowly ;-)
heheh
i think it might be better to first introduce the notes from the NM bof
sabdfl: ready as could be.
mako: go ahead
mako: OK, makes sense
because the new distctions between groups have a bearing on the way that this is done
righ
t
https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/NewDevelopersAndMaintainers
those are the super notes written up by plov
by way of background to folks who weren't in mataro
right
we had a great session brainstorming on our maintainer process
and i think the result is excellent
those notes they read pretty well as a summary of the conclusion we came to
it balances the need to empower people early on, with the need to keep the team technically exceptional
but the basic problem we were trying to solve was to find a way to recognize the contributions of people who are not developers or package maintainers
and to enfranchise them within the governnance system
and recognises that there are lots of ways people participate, and gives those people a voice
the document will do a better job than what t i can type now
but the basic idea is that we have members who are recognized by this body
and they will be able to confirm new members of the CC
and they should have contributed meaningful to the community
but they do not need to be package maintainers
the rest of the system is basically the same as before
procedurally, as I understand it, this means we approve members and then pass them to the TB for technical approval if they want to go one step further up; this reads as a codification of what we've been informally doing up to now
except that maintainer is now a purely technical distinction
Kamion: i'd prefer to think of it as a lateral step, but yes :)
either way :)
also clarifies the distinction between committer and maintainer
Kamion: it was unclear what to do with non-technical applicants in the past
right
and allows for commit rights to be given on specific components or packages
as a result, we have a couple people on the agenda for today who are applying for member status in the community but who are not currently pursuing TB approval to upload
mako: i think we should write this up as a formal doc and have it approved by the cc
and these are connected to thehe country teams as well
sabdfl: and then move it into the website governance page/pages
yeah, that sounds ideal.. i think that doc provides most of what we need
we can get going right away with new members, on the basis that the cc were all there
sabdfl: i'll have that ready for the next CC meeting
mako: great, thanks!
any initial comments from folks who were not at the mataro sessions?
it's also worth mentioning that there was some good work done on mentoring processes by Chris Haas
who is going to be helping out with a mentoring system for ubuntu.. really great work
yes
folks who are keen to become committers or maintainers would benefit greatly from spending some time with ChrisH
also, we agreed to review very quickly any proposed packages from new maintainer candidates
You are all invited for a pizza. ;)
I'm particularly glad to see that because it will mean that much of the mentoring process doesn't have to start with Canonical staff who are already heavily committed in many cases
but the actual detailed back and forth to get a package up to scratch if it isn't right first time is best handled by the mentoring process
ChrisH: where? :)
proposed packages> was it within two days or so?
two working, i think
mako, could you document the process on that front as well too please?
I think we should agree to at least get back to them with feedback within that time; there'll be cases of very large packages which take a long time to review
we'll need some sort of workflow to track that commitment
the key is to not leave people stalled during the review process
sabdfl: yes, of course
agreed
any other comments on the new maintainer process?
not right now
i'll send the draft to -devel
we just need some good, accessible docs for it I guess
so we can take discussion onto the lists
good idea
let move on
smurfix: you're up
do we have any members up for approval?
smurfix: only connected to doc team work
and country teams :)
sabdfl: ^^^
i meant country teams
right
So, back to country teams, as those who are on the CC agenda today want to become team leaders ;-)
two thinkos
smurfix: yes
looks like Treenaks and sivang are both up for membership approval?
Many of the country teams basically organized themselves -- we want to take advantage of that, recognize their contributions, and make that a more integrated part of Ubuntu
Kamion: right
The technical side of "what we want from the country team" is on the CountryTeams wiki page
the NM bof notes equate Ubuntite with activist, so that may not be the best term for use on the agenda
Kamion: i changed it
basically, IRC and mailing list and maybe a forum and whatnot
reload
mako: aha, thanks
can we agree on Ubuntite?
oh, there's a zillion typos waiting to happen there...
I think my main concern for country teams is that there should be somebody responsible for liaising with the primarily English-speaking development community as necessary
sabdfl: nothing we aren't used to :)
we can follow ubuntu-users (mostly ...), but generally not ubuntu-nl etc.
also it might make sense for Ubuntu to have a common second-level domain names if at all possible
Kamion: oh, good idea!
we could do nl.ubuntulinux.org etc very easily
Kamion: we can have them send summaries to be included in traffic!
that would be good
but i think it's more effective to have domains that match standard practice in that country
Kamion: in what way? for "localization needs"?
why not having localized ubuntu domains?
mako: great idea
that would be *great*
which the team leaders can help orgainze, though happily I co-own an ISP which does international domain registrations *grin*
sabdfl: I have already started doing that :) as of my conversation with lu from last week.
Treenaks: users frequently report bugs on the users mailing list
you all type way too fast for me ;-)
Kamion: oh stuff like that.. yeah forwarding/translating those would be an idea :)
we might want to make that Wiki list-of-stuff a more integral part of the site later; for now I've started the CountryTeamList page ten minutes ago
also, to help coordinate the migration of code into the main distro, like input methods and font decisions etc
sabdfl: that too, yes
sabdfl: the thing is, we need to see what std. form those localized sites can take, if to follow the main layout of ulinux.org etc, or have their own layout at the moment.
and to act as points of contact on geopolitical issues
although sometimes external observers may be less biased; it depends
i think we want to be as empowering as possible
there are tons of things that the team can do
which means offer people the use fo the official artwork and css if they want, but also let them to anything else if they think it suits their community better
agreed
but if it's only to provide an interface between existing ubuntu community and the rest of the project, it's owrthwhile
Kamion: hot button :-)
My list of the social part of the country team leader's responsibility so far:
i think we can think pretty big.. each team will be different
- be visible in the local community, of course ;-)
sabdfl: indeed - an important one for many countries though
- keep a list of regional contacts
- remind people of / enforce the CoC if necessary
smurfix: CoC = ?
code of conduct
Code of Conduct
eh
:0
:)
i'd like the country teams to have a high visibility on our home page
we thought of flags, but that can be too divisive
sabdfl:  a map?
and we may have to refer to the teams as "regional teams" rather than country teams
sabdfl: maybe a special section for the country team, like "Ubuntu in your country,lang etc"
the other stuff on my llist has already been mentioned while I was busy typing ;-)
*teams
flags *definitely* best avoided
likewise maps indicating country borders; you can go to jail in some countries for that (!)
sabdfl: yes, I notice lots of Flemish people (who also speak Dutch) come to the Dutch support
sabdfl: so it's more a language thing than a country thing for me
lithping ever thinth?
Treenaks: the distinction between these two isna't always readily apparent
isn't
smurfix: true..
i think we can push this convesation to the lists or put it on hold until afterwards
i think mark's suggestion to have good visible on the website is a good idea
we just need to iron out how to do it correctly
ok, but let's at least publically thank the guys who have stepped up so far
anyway, that's it from me, for now.
and invite them to have a say in ubuntu as members
we can do that
it's even on the agenda :)
is niels around?
who is he on irc?
i don't know his nick
does anyone know Niels Kjller Hansen's nick?
nope
he doesn't have a wiki page
then we can defer that decision unitl the next kmeeting
i think both sivang and Treenaks should be uncontroversial :)
Whee :)
kamion?
yey! :)
sivang and Treenaks were both at the conference and did good work there and both have been active in trying to help define what a country team is through planning and example
sabdfl: I don't, sorry
Kamion: que?
neils' nick
ah
niels, sorry
hehe
can we confirm them?
i was just checking if you were also happy with treenaks and sivang
or are thehere more questions?
oh, yes, I met them both and I'm fine with both
i'm thrilled with both of their contributions too
welcome aboard, both of you
thanks
sabdfl: thank you!
thanks all
sivang, Treenaks: could you update the draft list at CountryTeamList? (Though not at the same time please ;-)
smurfix: sure thing
Treenaks, sivang: you have the privledge/difficulty of defining the rules of this as you go :)
mako: cool :)
:)
you should stay in touch withs smurfix and myself who can bring your experience into best practices for groups that come after you :)
smurfix: would you like to play a more general role in the country teams?
did you take this one on?
sabdfl: dure
sabdfl: he did at the marketing meeting
sure
ok, let's document that on the wiki and site
smurfix: i mean, i don't want to speak for you :)
yes, i recall, was just looking for the bof notes :-)
this is a very exciting step
sabdfl: I'll update the pages as appropriate over the next couple days
we set a high goal: 50 countries for Hoary, right?
mako: i think this warrants a mail to -devel and -users as well
sabdfl: right.
sabdfl: at least
i'd rather concentrate things there than -announce for the moment
smurfix: lets work together to get announcment out by the end of thehe week
because we want it to reach people who are active
smurfix: updated
ther eis also -news
i think we've fallen off the end of the agenda
mako: Can you write a first draft?
let's stick to -devel and -users for the moment
smurfix: sure..
speaking of...
TB meeitng next week?
sivang: ping me when you're done editing the list page ?
sabdfl: postponed?
smurfix: k
mako: yes, i think so, can check with mdz later
sabdfl: alright.. we shoudl make an announcment
sabdfl: if it is postponed
ok, and update the wiki page
i'll update the wiki agenda pages now
any other business?
that's all i have now
nothing from me
sec
jan 4 same time
sivang had a last question, worth mentioning here
?
go ahead
What about localized websites? What if a country team cannot provide the hosting himself? will canonical be in help of that?
what sorts of things could help?
do we have sufficient plone suport for that?
support
not easily
plone is sort of all or nothing
stuff like automatic browser language detection?
hmm... yes i tihnk it does that
there are two ways of handlin this
so we can have pages in the main site that are translated, and served correctly
I remember someone in Mataro said it would be possible to provide the same pages (of www.ubuntulinux.org) in different languages.
was thinking more of being able to store the localised version of a page with the English one
jane and lulu and i talked at the conference about getting someone to handle website improvements and such
this sort of thing would be on the top of the list
rather than just kludging _nl onto the end of every page :)
I was speaking, could we get webspace over a cnonical server? :) or firms which we can interest in supporting ubuntu in that way?
Kamion: that'd suck :)
I can setup something on my hosted machine for people who need a place for hosting
we could also sponsor a web server for those country teams that need one, with virtual hosts for them
currently, folks just have translated pages in wikis and on their ownm servers
Kamion: the tacking-on-_nl thing
sabdfl: my thought exactly :)
sabdfl: might be nice
Treenaks: indeed
it would have limited shell support i imagine, but be good enough for website hosting
Let's keep the localised versions on the same server. No use to have a seperat server on the internet for each lang.
sabdfl: but almost all i've seen had php
mako: problem with that is that they get out of date trivially
translation tracking is just as important as a one-shot effort
which doesn't go over well with thom :)
Kamion: yes, of course
i tihnk some critical docs need to be translated on the main server
like CoC
i think a plone based solution makes  sthe most sense
we should see if we can have rosetta support web site translations :)
and governance docs, nm docs etc
Kamion: changes-mail, like the wiki does when you "subscribe" to a page?
but much of the local community stuff can best be hosted on a country-team website
like, when people are meeting up, and where
sabdfl: exactly
if people need space for that they can talk to me
since they're going to talk to me anyway ;-)
smurfix: that's very kind of you
sabdfl: don't worry, you'll get a bill for it ;-)  ;-)
oh, we're having a -nl dinner/keysigning some time in January -- if anyone's near Utrecht then, they're welcome to join
we'll start with that and see how this scales?
smurfix: alright.. perhaps we can trust some sort of short terms solution to the planning for the counry teams
if it turns into a lot of work we can rent space on a commercial basis somewhere for the teams
smurfix: do you have plone already installed? or moin moin? :)
sabdfl: I don't expect it will -- I'l speak up if it's going to be a problem.
ok guys, let's wrap up
sivang: good point though.. we definitely know it's a problem
sivang: moin, yes. Plone not yet
alright
Jan 4, 1600?
UTC?
sivang: I expect the stuff that needs plone to be located on the main site anyway
mako: tb?
that would be the currently scheduled CC meeting if we wait two weeks
if we just want to pretend like next week doesn't happen
smurfix: ah ok, I just wanted to .il one to have consistent look with the main one.
the next meeting would be in three weeks  son the 11th
mako: that makes sense
i tend to think that 2 weeks is a good interval but since one week will be holidays for many people, the 11th would work
ok, tb on jan 4th
thanks everybody
see you next year :)
:)
good 2004, guys
happy new year everybody :)
have a great festive season all
heh
yes, well done on this first year
cheers all
chhers
cheers
cheers
cheers
jordi: say "\o/\o/\o/"
what woudl jdub say? :)
PANTS OFF
heheh
in spanish
ok
time to catch my bus home
back in ~1.5 hours
sivang: "estoy buscando mi patalonis"
mako: exactly !
estic cercant els meus pantalons!
dudes, you gotta pick the Catalan trends.
hmm. wtf.
Quest-Master: no linux distro beats debian as far as upgradability/updatability is concerned, as i keep hearing.
Or Ubuntu.
Blackwell: ubuntu is debian......
Finkel is Einhorn
really 8)
ogra: so it would seem. but the same may apply to knoppix. however...the #debian folks seem to think that knoppix is not debian. i am afraid that ubuntu may spark the same level of not-welcomness.
Yeah.
#debian hates Knoppix to death.
I don't know about Ubuntu though.
Quest-Master: ;) i guess ubuntu may not have appeared on their radar yet.
But a lot of the Ubuntu developers are Debian developers as well.
how can you hate ubuntu?
Quest-Master: a channels doesn't hate anything, maybe some people on the channel do
so, there aren't any major stray-aways in ubuntu in comparison to debian, are there? nothing that would make debian folks groan and roll their eyes at?
Not really.
hey guys, since there are more people on #debian, do you think i could ask if anyone has already re-create a boot record from the ubuntu install cd?
Quest-Master: excellent news, thank you.
Blackwell: the company behind ubuntu has some of the most imoportant debian devs employed....they make sure all changes go back to debian
noob: try. report the reaction please. ;)
:)
i shouldnt do that ? :)
noob, you can do it
noob, yeah, the process is basically the same.. :)
ogra: ah, that sounds very good. :)
you can do whatever you like
sorry , i dont know thats why i ask you first
:P
this is a free network
Blackwell: ubuntu is synced quite often with sid before the release freeze
Blackwell: so in ubuntu unstable you get mostly debian sid with ubuntu-ongonig-changes
wtf? I can't get su.. su (enter) password: (password) and it won't work. this is far different from slackware.
:)
sudo su
dagron: ubuntu has copied off OSX
root is disabled by default
did you sign up for the slackware-rehab exam?
sudo su (enter) password ?
dagron: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo
yes dagraon
great
dagron: root has no password, so you can't login as root...
dagron*
unless you use webmin?
or has that been fixed? :)
dagron: after that you can "passwd" btw
you just sudo su for root access , if you want a root account, type sudo passwd root and then enter a new password
dunno. just installed ubuntu last hour or so.
sudo -s also works for a root shell
hey
nice
I'm trying to get some sort of nvidia hardware exceleration for my ubuntu imac
I have beep-media-player installed, how do I run it so taht I don't have to keep the terminal window open
for it to stay running
add a &
beep & disown
or run it from the menu :)
space or no?
space
Marble2: doesn't matter
doesnt work
still dies when I close the window
can I use screen?
beep&disown == beep    &    disown
i'm a screen newbie
Marble2: & disown
thanks dudes. now I have root :)
kk
np dagron ^+^
dagron: you wont gain anything with it
otherwise the shell just backgrounds it, and will kill it when it dies
thanks azta
worked
is everything different in ubuntu ?
np
no
dagron: no
thought it would be kind of like slack
dagron: all gui tools require gksudo
not everything, it's still linux
ogra: like you could do anything what you want without root?
dagron, it's very much debian :)
never used debian :S
thenuke: that as well ;)
im a slack fanatic
;)
dagron, this is the nicest debian experience I have ever tried :)
yes ubuntu is nice.
though it feels like the first time I sit in front of a pewter :S
anyone running ubuntu on ppc ?
tha_gamemaster: lots of ppl do......
tha_gamemaster: on a g3 ibook here
ogra,  is anyone of those people available for me to ask them a question ^_^
azta nvidia or ati card in your ibook?
tha_gamemaster: if it's regarding broken resume on wake no :)
tha_gamemaster: ATI rage mobility thing
azta hehe no I'm using it on an iMac, I experienced that error already on my ibook G3, I'm trying to enable hardware video acceleration.
Ubuntu can use Debian packages?
tha_gamemaster: ah, good luck :)
tha_gamemaster: runs fine on my imac at the office
dagron yea
I would love for dpkg/apt to be replaced in synaptic by a more library-ish interface
dagron: it is debian, just in a more friendly way, it seems.
dagron: preferably not; they're almost entirely available from universe/multiverse anyway
dagron: you shouldnt
tha_gamemaster: this only has 8mb videoram, which wasn't enough for the dri stuff
aah. just like Vidalinux ?
some users of webcam here ?
there's no dselect.. woohooo
tha_gamemaster: I haven't tried it in about 18 months though...
dagron: and ubuntu has 99% of the debian packages already in
ogra I have X, but you can tell from my opengl screen savers that there is no hardware exceleration...
dagron: (ubuntu is completely rebuilt, so there's no guarantee that actual debian packages will work)
could someone help me with getting my RAID 0 array working?
what the fuck is wrong with beep-media-player
its a POS
mplayer is good
Marble2, yes. Sadly
argh. but I want my aterm and irssi.. going to try at least
ungood: just mount it?
tha_gamemaster: i'll check it tomorrow if im at my shitty job ;)
just get mplayer or videolan client
prozac, what should I use?
ogra thank you ^_^
dagron: ubuntu seems strictly non commercial too, debian spirited in a way, i guess.
i want to play mp3s
Marble2, xmms or rhythmbox
ungood: what raid card ?
marble2, xmms
Blackwell: it's highly commercial (it's just Free, too)
can I apt-get it?
Promise Fasttrak 100
yep
cool
ungood: is it a true hardware raid card?
jdub: that burb on their page seemed to give a different impression. ;)
Marble2: rhythmbox is already there
azta: I don't think so
how does ubuntu work with non-alsa sound drivers?
it is shitty, i tried it
ungood: um :(
OSS supported ok?
xmms is the good old player
Marble2: dude, keep it nice please
xmms is the sucky old player
sorry
in uh rythmbox
it won't show my files
it import
Ubuntu sees the two drives, but it doesn't want to combine them into one, it seems.
did you install gstreamer0.8-mad?
I don't want to format them, because I would lose a ton of my music.
ungood: ah, you want the linux raid howto I guess
muine may be of use
Marble2: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
seeya azta
ok, I'll look into that. Thanks :)
Muine is sweet.
it does have that cool factor
brb
no-one?
vegai: what for oss ?
vegai: everything is replaced by alsa, oss will die anyway
hi
hello
I have a soundcard that's properly supported by only the 4Front driver. I was wondering whether oss is supported here
i've a big problem with gnome 2.9.2 on ubuntu hoary
what sound card?
vegai: there surely is an alsa driver that works
I sure hope that ALSA will become a bit better before it kills OSS
rwabel, yes?
ogra: negative.
the whole panel is away and the desktop is unusable
vegai: what card ?
brb
pozac: I don't know if it's a bug or sth like that. or if I did sth to the config
M-Audio Revolution 7.1, an ice1724-chip based card. And don't pretend to know more about this than me, please :)
yay
back
xmms kicks ass
rwabel, no, I think you just upgraded.. I had that problem too, not sure how I fixed it
vegai: /lib/modules/2.6.8.1-3-686/kernel/sound/pci/ice1712/snd-ice1724.ko
pozac: sudo apt-get upgrade and dist-upgrade didn't help
ogra: did I ask you not to pretend you know more about this than I?
ok, now what can I use to play video files
ouch
rwabel, I managed to get it running by trying a few times and killing leftover processes in between
is mpc linux compatabile?
vegai: there is a alsa module .... dont you think it works ?
good ol' ctrl-alt-backspace, slay pozac routine
yes, I've tried that module
it has problems
vegai: with the right options ?
slay is the coolest tool
What's with the attitude vegai? ogra's just trying to help.
yes
I'm in the middle of that myself.
Marble2, I recommend totem-xine
pozac: I tried to kill some gnome panels etc and I got only the taskbar from the bottom back. the rest like the desktop and the top panel still away
rwabel, do you use GDM? try startx
Quest-Master: how?
Marble2: totem-xine was pretty unstable for me. Use gxine.. simple, fast :)
killall gnome-panel
pozac: yes gdm. tried startx, reboot, restart gdm
yes, ok, sorry. I guess you get a lot of clueless people here sometimes.
Quest-Master: thank you, i can cope with that ..... in fact he warned me ;)
macewan: ahh that one I didn't know yet. I've to go back to gnome window manager, I'm in xfce at the moment
is ubuntu slow on anyone else's laptop? odd.
rwabel, I don't think I know then, sorry.. :(
stuNNed_: you don't happen to have a toshiba, do you?
lol
but back to the question... I guess everything's linked against OSS libraries too?
brb
I shouldn't be worried, though. The 4Front driver has an ALSA emulating layer
pozac: I'll try the killall gnome-panel
like ALSA has an OSS emulating layer ;)
hey, anyone here have any experience with webhosts and python scripts?
kinda ironic...
vegai: warty is set up to use alsa drivers, but via the oss emulation modules (not using alsalibs)
hmm, it will tough then :/
rwabel, do that
jdub: it's mostly autodetected, right?
no
evenin
ok, that's better
if you want to use oss stuff, it will just work
jdub: no, but I don't want ALSA.
jdub, no dell inspiron 1.8ghz cpu/512ram/gf2go and it's pretty slow for some reason, refreshing windows and the like
unless you alsa driver's oss layer thingie sucks :(
oh, right. Sorry again :)
pozac: seems that the probem is only related to my specific user. loging in with another user works fine
good
Question: anyone compiled an Eggdrop bot on Ubuntu yet?
hello people....
Pozac: the in-kernel oss emulation stuff is better than using alsalibs atm
rwabel, yeah - perhaps something in ~/.gconf ?
Pozac: that's why we chose to use it
how can i know if i'm using the latest ubuntu distro version?
i'm attempting to do an install of ubuntu on my laptop, and before with other distros i'd have to do ide=nodma at boot, but i dont know what `kernel` put in there and such, so i dont know what to do because it wont detect cd
toxickore: there is only one currently
jdub, ok :)
toxickore: cat /etc/lsb-release, if it says 'warty' and 4.10, you're using the latest release.
jd85: let's see
jd85: yup... it's the 4.10
jd85: thank you dude..
toxickore: may i add i'm a gentoo user and just need somthing that wont hog all of my cpu on my laptop lol its a 266, do you think it will run alright? its a p2
oops
not to toxickorebut to everyone
ooops...
yea two oops
jd85: RAM matters, not CPU
jdub: my answer was to you
jd85: =P
jdub: i have 128mb... that enough
jdub: if i can even get it to 'find the cd'
pozac: no luck. it only gave me back the bottom panel. ther other one where the gnome stuff is (like system etc) is still away
i'd recommend 256MB at the least for using gnome on ubuntu
(gnome plus anything useful on top)
rwabel, and you can't click on anything, right?
jdub: well thats the max the laptop can take, have any suggestions? its only got a 3.1 gig hard drive..
rwabel: killall gnome-vfs-daemon nautilus trashapplet gnome-panel
jd85: you could try xfce4 as a replacement with smaller footprint
pozac: right
ogra: but not with ubuntu?
jd85: should work with 128 but you wont benefit form all the nice gnome integration
jdub: thanks, gonna try that one out
jd85: sure with ubuntu....
I would like to once again point out that 'slay' is a wonderful tool no keen ubuntu user should be without.
gar
sorry, but what is slay for? :)
i can't get audio working on VLC
I am running a caching server with 64MB of ram with Ubuntu. It is CERTAINLY not useable as a desktop with that little ram though.
any ideas?
noob, it kills all processes belonging to a user :)
ok
:)
like the name sort of implies :)
jdub: yeah great nautilus and trahsapplet did the job. thank you very much
I think 128 Might be ok, but I am getting a 256MB stick for it and a small monitor so I can use synergy to add it to my desktop.
:)
anyone?
Marble2, hold on, lemme install it...
Marble2, you get sound in everything else?
jdub, any idea why it might be slow?
yea
jdub, this is ubuntu unstable, current.
xmms and such gets sound
brb bathroom
stuNNed_: with xcompmanager ?
jdub: but after a logout and login again the same problem
have you tried multiple files Marble2
?
ogra, not sure if i'm using that or not, haven't manually enabled it.
rwabel: do it again, and save your session as you log out
stuNNed_: no strong ideas, no
stuNNed_: it draws shadows around your windows and you have to enable it .....
ogra, then no
judb: thanks
jdub, could be 'nvidia' drivers or whatever agp i'm using you think?
ogra, thanks
stuNNed_: dunno
yes zenwhen
stuNNed_: nvidia drivers form where ? are there any for xorg already ?
i have
ogra, yes
ogra, using what's in ubuntu unstable
ogra, which is not latest afaik
Do OTHER video apps exhibit this issue?
Marble2, hmm.. do you have the sound server enabled?
I again recommend totem-xine.
i'll try totem-xine
Check Settings -> preferences and make sure "Use spdif when available" isnt checked as well.
xmms is like winamp in the old days, and totem-xine is like a good edition of the classic windows media player :)
under Audio.
Gxine is good as well.
BEFORE everyone had to live off writing media players :(
i just unchecked it zenwhen
still no audio
damn
try running vlc from a terminal and see if it shows errors
like /dev/dsp in use or whatnot
the hell
a vlc restart fixed it
works like a charm now
It might be the sound server :)
It ws the spdif thing i bet.
vlc is good
probably
KMIX does the same thing if you install KDE but it takes away ALL sound.
lol
I've had some sync issues with it in the past
judb: by default it saves the session. is there a way to tell gnome to do it explicit?
gnome-session-save perhaps?
rwabel: it doesn't save the session by default. click log out, look at the option at the bottom of the logout box.
Hmmm. Either at or atq is broken
jdub: there are no option only logout, reboot and shutdown
looks like at
My at says Garbled time
hehe
rwabel: 'save current setup' at the top
hi all
hey
rwabel, you can run 'gnome-session-save'
jdub: strange. are you sure.... and then the 3 options
pozac: thanks gonna try that
how can I test what type of framebuffer I'm running ?
like what driver it's using from the kernel.
rwabel, I also have that option
brb
pozac: yes, it worked. thanks...must have a different logout version. or maybe it's a setting question in gnome
thanks for the help
np
Who is Remote?

mdke, ah thanks for looking ^_^
tha_gamemaster: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto
Marble2, By the way, you should do a search in synaptic for xmms.. there are lots of plugins for it :)
ogra, gimme 5

/slap ogra
tha_gamemaster: you need the nvidia-glx package or d/l the source and compile it for yourself
ogra, did I forget to mention I'm not using x86 ^_^

tha_gamemaster: hmm
xevil, does the source work on ppc?
tha_gamemaster: uh... you didn't mention that... I don't know

mdke: heh

mdke: learning and listening a lot
mdke: meeting cool ppl
:)
mdke: taking photos: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/ConferenceGalleries
os x is just SO draining on these resources... I just need more ram to enjoy the  computer I suppose.
what were they talking about?
ram is like sex, ...
mdke: and starting this: http://www.grawert.net/xss_shot_1.png
I'm new to ubuntu.  I've been using Linux for ten years for my pc.  So I've got a coupla questions.  Is therea utiility for setting mode lines under XFConfig?  My screen is slightly off center and it's annoying.  There are things on the right side I can't read or access.
Blackwell, ain't it the truth ^_^
mdke: all the special ubuntu stuff.... some basics on packaging and the exciting launchpad stuff
oh well, kernel compilation time.
urgs, my sympathies.
mdke: indeed there was a lot more, but thats what i picked.....
ogra, what is that xss thing?
mdke: and the cool new desktop thingies that will come with hoary ... hehe
mdke: the xsceensaver lock dialog
Anyone got any suggestions before I  compile my  first ubuntu kernel? (so far I've done gentoo and debian)
oh, the kicking cops picture :)
tha_gamemaster: you'll do fine i bet.
you don't sound like a kernel recompilation allergic like me.
sjoerd: in the gallery ?
http://www.grawert.net/mataro/img113.jpeg.html
sjoerd: i took also the toilet signs
sjoerd: for fabio, he was so impressed
Blackwell nope, but then again, just because you're not allergic, doesn't mean you're the first to run and participate ~_^
hehe
ogra: where was that again
sjoerd: in the last bar before the big party
oh right
tha_gamemaster: get kernel-package and have fun...
xevil, thanks ^_^
tha_gamemaster: did you use kernel-package with Debian?
gtkpod takes bloody ages to add directories to the list
anyone else use gtkpod?
Hey everyone
I've just tested out the shadow feature of x.org. Looks nice, but the system gets unusable due to too much ressource usage.
rwabel: yep
rwabel: its a known issue.....
I'm setting up my ubuntu server and I'm looking for a simple yet nice looking CMS for my personal web site. Image gallery, news, web links...can you suggest anything?
ogra: I hear, didn't think that it would be so heavy ! but nice to see ;-)
Does anyone know of any way to determine whether my network card is working or not?
I'm having problems with getting it to connect to anything
The case is: I have a cable plugged into my router, the cable works fine on my laptop
Pugio, ifconfig
rwabel: it will get lighter and faster..... ita a matter of time ;)
pugio: can you do a ifconfig from cmd prompt
I did
hang on
let me switch the cable out
Pugio, does it show up?
ogra: isn't it a problem with the opengl?
Any CMS that you guys use?
"Pugio quit (Connection reset by peer)"" ;)
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Blackwell	(not that cable, i hope)
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	mdke	Pugio, if it doesn't show up
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	ok
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	ogra_dogwalk	rwabel: rahter with the apps i think.....
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	had to switch the cable
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	mdke	try ifconfig -a
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	I'm using the laptop's wireless
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	mdke	Tyche, what is cms?
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pozac	content management system
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	ifconfig eth0 shows up
2005-01-01T01:18:00.000Z	Pugio	but It can't connect to anything
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	rwabel	ogra: why with the apps? aren't the apps independent of it?
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	and yet, I had just connected to you using the very same cable/connection
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: ping gets through?
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	nope
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	nothing
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	SeFoKumA	yeah
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Tyche	mdke: A Content Management System. So that I can have a personal website with nice admin utilities to add news, images and links.
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	it doesn't even have an ip
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	and I can't figure out how to get it working
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	mdke	Pugio, how are you starting it?
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: pinging what, some windows or firewalled box? what's the ip config of both? does it show a link on the router?
2005-01-01T01:19:00.000Z	Pugio	ok
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	here's the deal
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	my network is mostly unfirewalled
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	I'm pinging a Mac OS X machine
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	the eth0 card has no Ip address
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Pugio	the Ubuntu network settings control has the card
2005-01-01T01:20:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: does that os x box respond to pings? make sure it does. have an ip address. no worky without, i guess.
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	but every time I click ""Activate"" it activates for a sec and then deactivates
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: maybe the system log shows why?
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	ok, the box does respond to pings
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	erm, which one?
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	(what's the command for that again?)
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: the one on the machine which fails to activate the network card.
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Pugio	right, what I meant was, where's that log located
2005-01-01T01:21:00.000Z	Blackwell	i expect the system log shows which module is attempted to be loaded (if any) and why it fails.
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	woops
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: no idea :)
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	duh!
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	hang on
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	this is a standard ubuntu install
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	ok here we go
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	pkellow	does anyone know how to fix the broken package of the samba?
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	Pugio	I got something
2005-01-01T01:22:00.000Z	pkellow	i would greatly appreciate it
2005-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	Blackwell	pkellow: remove and install again?
2005-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	pkellow	just the samba
2005-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	Blackwell	pkellow: or install a package from somewhere else? windows style admin approach, i know, but hey, might work. :)
2005-01-01T01:23:00.000Z	Pugio	It says: ""localhost dhclient: DHCPDISCOVER on eth0 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 11
2005-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Pugio	there's a whole bunch of those
2005-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Pugio	with the last interval number changing each time
2005-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Pugio	then it says ""localhost dhclient: No DHCPOFFERS received
2005-01-01T01:24:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: seems you should configure an ip address.
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Pugio	but I'm using a DHCP server
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Blackwell	it goes offline because it is configured to use DHCP and fails to acquire an ip config that way, i guess.
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: <shrug> i'd do without dhcp first, just to make sure everything is ok without dhcp anyway.
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Pugio	right, but it's never done this before
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Pugio	ok, hang on
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	Blackwell	now it does. :)
2005-01-01T01:25:00.000Z	pkellow	umm what is the last version of samba that works with ubunut
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Blackwell	ubunut, nice one :)
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pugio	i already tried to give it a static ip
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pugio	but here goes again
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Blackwell	pkellow: ubuntu is debian, i hear. so...
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: tried and failed? or tried and succeeded, yet no change of state?
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pugio	tried and failed
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	pkellow	i know its debian i was just wondering
2005-01-01T01:26:00.000Z	Pugio	butk, as I said, here goes again
2005-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	Blackwell	ah, so get that manual ip configuration going first, i guess. :)
2005-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	Blackwell	pkellow: unless it says otherwise, we must assume that it is ""100% compatible"", i guess.
2005-01-01T01:27:00.000Z	Pugio	right, but that's not working either
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Pugio	I'm at a loss
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	macewan	the ladies smile as macewan announces that he's back
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: you fail at configuring the ip address of your network card?
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Blackwell	there's ladies in here? <drool>
2005-01-01T01:28:00.000Z	Pugio	well, it configures, (i'm using the ubuntu GUI for network config) but I still can't connect to anything
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	macewan	:)
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: post the ip config of both boxes.
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	Pugio	ok
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	Blackwell	or post somewhere, don't know if channel is okay. just don't flood.
2005-01-01T01:29:00.000Z	Pugio	it's only 3 fields
2005-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	Pugio	Dead Box: ip: 192.168.123.150 - subnet: 255.255.255.255.0 - gateway: 192.168.123.254
2005-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	Blackwell	that subnet mask worries me.
2005-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	Pugio	Live Bod: ip: 192.168.123.172 - the rest is the same
2005-01-01T01:30:00.000Z	Pugio	erm
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	sorry
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	that's only 3 sets of 255
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	not four
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Blackwell	:)
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	the DNS servers are also identical
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	as I said, it worked fine before
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	Pugio	just not anymore
2005-01-01T01:31:00.000Z	krischan	Hey, what application are available to play back MIDI files?
2005-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: who provides the dhcp service?
2005-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	Pugio	my router
2005-01-01T01:32:00.000Z	Pugio	remember, it's hard configured now anyway
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	Pugio	I have an Asante something or other router
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	Pugio	it's worked ok before
2005-01-01T01:33:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: does the router activity led light up when you fire up ping or the activation of the network interface?
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	brute method to check, i know, but...
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: i assume the router provides dhcp service to the other boxes ok?
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: the router/nic link leds are lit?
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	hmm
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: using another port on the router doesn't change anything?
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	they weren't
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	nope
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	but...
2005-01-01T01:34:00.000Z	Pugio	I think I got it
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	dumb dumb dumb me
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	well, no link no fun
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	you used the wrong port? ;)
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	no
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	this cable is slightly messed up
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	aha
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	it doesn't seat right in the slot
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Blackwell	no spare to play with, eh?
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	fender	need some help, how do you get audio from a dvd? can't install dvdrip or ffmpeg. which would do the job.
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	it worked on the laptop
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	cause the slot was slightly smaller
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	nope, no spares
2005-01-01T01:35:00.000Z	Pugio	actually, this was my spare
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: get some, too cheap to miss
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	haha :)
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Pugio	i know
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	sgood1971	Can anyone tell me how to open a port?
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	sgood1971: run a software which listens on that port.
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	fender	need some help, how do you get audio from a dvd? can't install dvdrip or ffmpeg. which would do the job.
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Pugio	now, lets see if I can stuff something into this slot to seat it
2005-01-01T01:36:00.000Z	Blackwell	fender: repeating is not friendly, esp. not at these intervals.
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	sgood1971	Blackwell: I am trying to run amule and I get a lowid because I need 4266 opened. I tried sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i eth1 -p tcp --dport 4662 -j ACCEPT but it still is not open.
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	Pugio: try to switch cables around, if that is an option. configure the interface back, too, i guess.
2005-01-01T01:37:00.000Z	Blackwell	sgood1971: haha, alright. no clue about linux firewall stuff, sorry.
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	fender	does anyone know how to get audio from a dvd on to my hard drive?
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	Blackwell	hello mrs. ubuntu :)
2005-01-01T01:38:00.000Z	Blackwell	fender: slightly rephrasing may still be considered repeating.
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	Pugio	well, I finally was able to kick someone else off of the other machine
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	Pugio	so, now I'm testing it with his cable and it works fine - of course
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	fender	blackwell:well, i want to know how to get audio from a dvd.
2005-01-01T01:39:00.000Z	sgood1971	fender: There is a thread on http://linuxquestions.org that covers dvd-shrink using wine.
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	Pugio	but, the cable works on his machine (the ""dead"" one)
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	Pugio	so everythings great now:)
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	Pugio	thanks for the help
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	fender	sgood1971:thank you, i'll try it.
2005-01-01T01:40:00.000Z	sgood1971	fender: just use the search and look for dvd shrink
2005-01-01T01:42:00.000Z	macewan	fender: mplayer does this I believe
2005-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	fender	yeah, i think it uses ffmpeg. well, i think it does. but i can't get ffmpeg, failed dependencies
2005-01-01T01:43:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender http://www.digital-digest.com, they have some linux software there, otherwise mplayer and transcode (if you want to do some well worth-while learning). Also there is DVD::RIP for linux.
2005-01-01T01:44:00.000Z	tha_game|away	(mplayer/mencoder)
2005-01-01T01:44:00.000Z	fender	i know about dvdrip, used it on freebsd, can't get to work on ubuntu, dependencies is a nightmare when trying to install dvdrip on suse. tried downloading transcode, same problem with that, failed dependencies.
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	fender	downloaded mplayer through apt-get and it doesn't work, doesn't load.
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	macewan	why are sound blaster cards such a bitch with ubuntu??
2005-01-01T01:45:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender intersting, I used to use dvdrip through mandrake and had no problems...
2005-01-01T01:46:00.000Z	tha_game|away	macewan pci or isa?
2005-01-01T01:46:00.000Z	macewan	pci
2005-01-01T01:46:00.000Z	tha_game|away	macewan, hrm, I haven't tried it myself but I will be trying it soon, pci should be no problem...
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	fender	if you got to dvdrip's website it needs 10 or more dependencies including mplayer.
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender, and ubuntu/debian doesn't have all the binary dependencies?
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	macewan	two different sound blaster types were tried, both barfed in different ways.
2005-01-01T01:47:00.000Z	fender	well, i've only started using ubuntu and i think it
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	tha_game|away	macewan, ya got me, I've still  not messed with it on ubuntu.
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	fender	is a pleasure to use.
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	macewan	true pleasure, I use it at work.
2005-01-01T01:48:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender, I agree with you completely as I am in the same situation.  I'll be trying what you're doing in the next couple of days, if you have not gotten it to work by then and I am successful, I will guide you through it.
2005-01-01T01:49:00.000Z	fender	ok
2005-01-01T01:50:00.000Z	lexhider	does anyone else not have a logout menu item in hoary?
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	jlund	I''m trying to add a program to the existing 'Internet' group in the Applications menu but going to 'applications://' in nautilus is giving me an error. How do I manually add a program?
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	macewan	compiling latest alsa-driver, should i compile oss emulation
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	fender	i got the audio from an mpeg file, using ffmpeg, but you need to use a few commands in the terminal or shell.
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	tha_game|away	nrn
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	tha_game|away	brb*
2005-01-01T01:51:00.000Z	cardador	lexhider: that happens to me normally after a dist-upgrade. try ro restart x, or reboot.
2005-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	macewan	lexhider: never had that while i used hoary
2005-01-01T01:52:00.000Z	magnon	me neither
2005-01-01T01:53:00.000Z	lexhider	interesting, I've currently had to put a logout applet on panel.
2005-01-01T01:53:00.000Z	fender	i got the audio from an mpeg file in freebsd, only problem is i'm trying to get the audio from the source...DVD.
2005-01-01T01:53:00.000Z	fender	in ubuntu.
2005-01-01T01:54:00.000Z	lexhider	I'll see if I can rectify
2005-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	jlund	I'm trying to add a program to the existing 'Internet' group in the Applications menu but going to 'applications://' in nautilus is giving me an error. How do I manually add a program?
2005-01-01T01:55:00.000Z	macewan	just right click from the menu itself
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	jlund	That closes the Applications list
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	jlund	I am on Hoary, dunno if that matters
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender let me install ffmpeg and see if i can do it.
2005-01-01T01:56:00.000Z	macewan	applications > Internet 'right click in the Internet menu on top of one of the existing 'net apps'
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	jlund	macewan: that closes the launcher
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: its currently not possible in hoary
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	jlund	oh
2005-01-01T01:58:00.000Z	jlund	Why is that?
2005-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: because its hoary
2005-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: its in steady development
2005-01-01T01:59:00.000Z	fender	the_game|way: go to http://www.bunkus.org/dvdripping4linux/en/separate/tricks.html for some information, it might be a little bit useful.
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	Hm, seems like a weird thing to not be able to do
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: be happy that nothing essential is currently broken ;)
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	Oh well, I just added a little icon for it which works
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	Yes, I am very happy with hoary
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	I'm glad it's not just me!
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	jlund	Thanks
2005-01-01T02:00:00.000Z	ogra	jlund: it will get fixed.....
2005-01-01T02:01:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender, checking...
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	tha_game|away	fender, yea that's what i was gunna recommend but you can't get mplayer installed.
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	jlund	ogra - I have no doubt of that. I will keep doing updates and dist-upgrades :)
2005-01-01T02:02:00.000Z	ogra	;)

2005-01-01T02:05:00.000Z	imka	i need to recrute some hungarian ubuntu users so they help me on rosetta
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	kergan	i am trying to get ppl on my irc network to convert to ubuntu
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	kergan	specaly for the irc servers
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	kergan	ubuntu is far stabler than suse
2005-01-01T02:06:00.000Z	dataw0lf	good for you.
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	imka	kergan it's not hard to convince some1 for ubuntu :)
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	kergan	i agree
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	kergan	the 1 person i was trying to convert was wanting to try gentoo
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	dataw0lf	so it's not much of an announcement.
2005-01-01T02:07:00.000Z	kergan	and i talked him out of it
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	tha_game|away	has anyone successfully installed mplayer on ubuntu?
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	kergan	me
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	imka	tha_game yes, earlier
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	kergan	but it dont work like it should
2005-01-01T02:08:00.000Z	imka	but it wouldnt work with my new install
2005-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	tha_game|away	imka, I'm trying to get fender some help with installation, can't find anything in the wiki...
2005-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	imka	i think its because of package conflicts. i have totem-xine with w32codecs and libdvdcss and it works like a charm. gnome look and feel rulz
2005-01-01T02:09:00.000Z	kergan	i like the gnome-xine
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	tha_game|away	yea but we need the mplayer for some video editing.
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	kergan	tha_game|away,  cant you use xine
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	ogra	tha_game|away: tried kino for that ?
2005-01-01T02:10:00.000Z	imka	tha_game if you really want it, you need to add a line to sources.list
2005-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	tha_game|away	orga kino doesn't use mpeg2 video (especially not of the vob calibur)
2005-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	tha_game|away	kergan xine for video editing?
2005-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	tha_game|away	brb
2005-01-01T02:11:00.000Z	imka	tha_game what kinda video editing. just cutting or what?
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	ogra	imka: vob indicates video cd
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	bob2	vob indicates dvd
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: hey bob
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: home again ?
2005-01-01T02:12:00.000Z	imka	ah okay, vob. sry
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	bob2	yeah, only took...35 hours
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	bob2	including a missed flight
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	ogra	:-O
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	Gwildor	hello :)
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	Gwildor	i just installed enlightenment, and, before, i have installed other WM that didnt make it to the <session> menu at the log in screen
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	ogra	but at least you got it warm there
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	sulkd	imka: I got w32 codecs in /usr/lib/win32 and still totem isn't showing wmvs.. how'd you configure it?
2005-01-01T02:13:00.000Z	Gwildor	any idea how to add them
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	bob2	just don't use totem
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	bob2	install mplayer or gxine
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	imka	use totem-xine
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	lexhider	well, I still haven't got a logout menu thing, I'll just hope it returns in a dist-upgrade in the future.
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	bob2	totem-xine is a waste of your time
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	imka	the default totem uses gstreamer, which kinda sucks
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	bob2	a simple rhyme to give you...lime
2005-01-01T02:14:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: hmm, never had probs with it
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	imka	bob2 i guess its a matter of preference. it works for me
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	bob2	gstreamer is prohibited by law from being awesome
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	imka	lol
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: lol
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	bob2	imka: ogra you guys won't come complaining here when your hoary upgrade breaks, tho
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	bob2	other people will, since they don't know what ubuntu-desktop is for
2005-01-01T02:15:00.000Z	ogra	bob2: i know what to do ;)
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	imka	bob2 do you really think a missing ubuntu-desktop will break things? im not sure
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	ogra	btw, vlc is a good tool too
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	ogra	imka: it will !
2005-01-01T02:16:00.000Z	bob2	imka: lack of gamin on hoary makes things irritatingly slow
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	imka	well, in that case, i just install ubuntu-desktop be4 upgrading and then reinstall totem-xine
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	imka	but why would it break it?
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	Blackwell	grmblfx, doesn't use the keyboard layout i specified at install time, grrr
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	kergan	i never had the prob of missing ubuntu-desktop
2005-01-01T02:17:00.000Z	imka	kergan, r u running hoary?
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	kergan	yes
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	imka	cool
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	Blackwell	that's...not nice when trying to login with the non ascii char containing password you so cleverly chose...
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	mike998	just say I wanted to try running hoary but didnk'
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	ogra	night all
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	imka	night
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	kergan	and it works just as well ass the werty
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	mike998	t want to reinstall my warty...  could I do it by changing my repositories?
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	bob2	mike998: you can move to hoary from warty without reinstalling, but not the other way round
2005-01-01T02:18:00.000Z	sulkd	heh.. ubuntu-desktop is just a virtual package.. it gets ""removed"" in your dist-upgrade whenever a package it represents is removed, like when they refactor some of the Ubuntu specific stuff and a package gets thrown out or renamed
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	bob2	sulkd: no it dopesn't
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	sulkd	the entire thing doesnt get removed when you see that
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	imka	well, i keep hearing this and that how important ubuntu-desktop is. but people who don't have it and upgraded say it 's okay
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	fender	can't believe it, need audio from a dvd, totem plays audio and no video. lol.
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	bob2	imka: yes, it's fine to remove it, if you know what it does
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	mike998	bob2: clarify for me... Hoary is gonna be the next release, right?  or was it the last release?
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	imka	yea, it's just a meta package
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	kergan	fender,  check for the dvdcss
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	bob2	imka: encouraging ""newbies"" to remove it means they will get lost and broken systems at some point in the future
2005-01-01T02:19:00.000Z	bob2	mike998: next
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	imka	bob2 aight sir, i shut up LOL
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	bob2	mike998: but it's under very heavy development, don't upgrade unless you can handle a broken system and don't mind things changing a lot
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	fender	i havwe got dvdcss, i played the dvd earlier with ogle.
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	kergan	hmm
2005-01-01T02:20:00.000Z	kergan	check your vidoe settings

2005-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	scoon	LostMonk, monk, you will be a ""found monk""when you dump winhell
2005-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	Adrenal	u need more space
2005-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	scoon	LostMonk, get the live cd
2005-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	LostMonk	i need more money
2005-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	LostMonk	:)
2005-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	scoon	LostMonk, and use that for a spell. it will be a bit slow
2005-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	kergan	LostMonk,  just dump win all together
2005-01-01T03:03:00.000Z	scoon	LostMonk, but you will get a ""feel"" as to what is up.
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	LostMonk	Blackwell: i dont wanna completely dump my windows, and have no clue how to use this or nothign
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Adrenal	its piss to use dude
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Gwildor	LostMonk, i dropped my windose install without ANY linux expierience.......ubuntu makes it pretty easy
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Adrenal	except for installing drivers
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	kergan	LostMonk,  linux is a much more mature os as comparied to win
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	bob2	DagaZ: thanks :)
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Adrenal	AAARGGHHH
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	kergan	windows likes to hold your hand
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Adrenal	yeh
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Adrenal	the only way to learn linux is to get rid of window
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Adrenal	shred the cd
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	Adrenal	delete the partition
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	LostMonk	what about some word docs that i have, is there gonna be anyway to transfer them over to linux?
2005-01-01T03:04:00.000Z	bob2	you don't normally need to install drivers under linux
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Adrenal	if u have the oppurtuntiy to go back
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Adrenal	u will
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Adrenal	and you won't learn
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	kergan	LostMonk, openoffice will read any doc you throw at it
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	bob2	Adrenal: lots of people choose linux over windows on it's merits, rather than because they have to
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	bob2	LostMonk: openoffice can read msot any word document
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	Gwildor	LostMonk, open office, itll open your text doc's
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	kergan	and mso documents
2005-01-01T03:05:00.000Z	LostMonk	ok
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	scoon	LostMonk, listen, download the live ubuntu disc
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	kergan	trust use
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	kergan	us
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	LostMonk	now, will ubuntu configure my cable hook up automatically?
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	kergan	ubuntu makes it really easy
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	Gwildor	LostMonk, if you want to be 100% sure you will still be able to read your doc's, you can install open office in windows, and try to open them all
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	scoon	and see if open office works they way you like it.
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	Gwildor	LostMonk, it did for me
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	bob2	LostMonk: depends how it's setup
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	bob2	LostMonk: if your cable modem hands out dhcp, yes
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	LostMonk	i dunno what it does
2005-01-01T03:06:00.000Z	LostMonk	:P
2005-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	mike998	It's probably DHCP then
2005-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	kergan	do you have to login like a 56k dial up
2005-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	kergan	??
2005-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	LostMonk	nope
2005-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	kergan	then its dhcp
2005-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	LostMonk	i just open the browser
2005-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	kergan	and its n/p then
2005-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	Blackwell	LostMonk: hm, check the nick completion, you seem to use my nick accidentally.
2005-01-01T03:07:00.000Z	LostMonk	what about irc?

2005-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	bob2	xchat is installed by default on ubuntu
2005-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	kergan	using snyapttic
2005-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	kergan	bob2, is right
2005-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	mike998	most of the stuff you want is installed by default
2005-01-01T03:08:00.000Z	mike998	if someone can give you the ubuntu getting started guide, you are set
2005-01-01T03:09:00.000Z	LostMonk	i gotta make sure to save some of my docs and stuff

2005-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	kergan	LostMonk,  yes
2005-01-01T03:11:00.000Z	mike998	LostMonk: what operating system are you running right now?

2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	bob2	yes, but you won't be able to write to it
2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	Quest-Master	How can I search for these? gxineplugin.a gxineplugin.la gxineplugin.so
2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	miggumike	hey
2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	mike998	partition magic springs to mind
2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	miggumike	can i automount a partition when i boot up?
2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	bob2	miggumike: of course
2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	mike998	miggumike: you will have to adjust your fstab
2005-01-01T03:12:00.000Z	bob2	miggumike: and there's no need to repeat over and over
2005-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	kergan	miggumike, http://ubuntuguide.org/ <--lok thare
2005-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	miggumike	yeah sorry about that i joined linuxhelp but i stayed in here
2005-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	miggumike	:/
2005-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	kergan	Quest-Master,  whare do you want to look??
2005-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	mike998	miggumike: check your /etc/fstab file for an example of how it works
2005-01-01T03:13:00.000Z	mike998	well, it's the way it works... be careful with it
2005-01-01T03:14:00.000Z	mike998	Quest-Master ""find / -name gxineplugin.* -print"
mike998,  thats in the file system wot if he wants to look for it in the package manger
kergan: oh.  I didn't see him mention where he wanted to look for it
lol
ya hence i ask whre do he want to look??
meh, I'm trying to help... time for me to give something back and tonight is the night
me too
lol
ahhh i see
my irc network is dead no one is talking so i thought i come here and hang out awile
and help nubs
lol
lol - where do you usually hang out?
the biteme network
its a private network
not on the big irc lists
ah i see
hehe
i only use irc for a game mostly
i got another window open on the #fark channel
i helped set it up 5-6 years ago
not really reading it
lol
i sit on 13 chanels on my network
trade mp3s and such
Holy...  I have two windows open right now and have difficulty keeping track when both are talking
sorry got side tracked earlier
:)
oh I see.  Well, I usually use BitTorrent
me too
pity that suprnova et al went down
but irc i can get just one song if i want and not the whole album
wow there are a lot of users in this channel
yeah, very true.
suprnove works just fine for me
2 windows?
thats it?
really ?  the IRC channel?
i got 16 total open
yep
i got 18 on 3 servers
not the irc chanel i thank
Crane: don't go into #debian, it's got 706 at the moment
the webpage works
can u have multiple servers with xchat?
LostMonk: Yah.  I can't multitask.  If I try to chew gum and walk at the same time I usually end up falling over
and that got a notice saying thay got the irc chanel up and running agine
LostMonk: yes
good
:)
LostMonk: Yeah, check out the first option (file?)
i play a huge online game that i need alot of irc open for
I'm in ubuntu and a clan channel
ya LostMonk  you can
LostMonk, xchat is available for windows, if you want to try that first, as well
ubuntu shows 293 users
nah, ill figure it out once i install
kk :)
LostMonk: New -> Server Tab
yep
thats how i learned mIRC
just like that
LostMonk: The advice to try some of these apps in windows first is a really good idea.
LostMonk,  ya thats the way just play with it till its broke then you know how it works
now, if i have issues getting online once i switch, what should i do?
lol
I use XP at work (I have to) but I use Gimp and gaim and opeonoffice
LostMonk,  you shouldent have any probs
i have trillian pro for windows
I haven't had a problem
you paid for it?
thats the only thing i am really worried about
good man
nope :)
pay?
ah
LostMonk: always a good idea to figure out what you use to connect to things first.. eg: dsl/cable/dial-up
is this your first time with linux Monk
?
everytime i have reloaded windows, its autodone everything with the cable
yes crane
i don't see where it explains how to automount a partition when i bootup
I've tried many distros and had very little prob connecting
LostMonk: you're on cable? dhcp and the like? no special program to log you in or anything?
miggumike take a look at your /etc/fstab file
icable
cef we allredy did that
nope, nothing special
hehe
/dev/hda2       /share         vfat    umask=000       0       0
i dont mind
this is great
should have no problems then
LostMonk: then it should work fine.. no problems
most support channels i come across are empty
:P
ok i'm in it
is a line I have added to automount my second partition
LostMonk: only thing you might have issues with itself is the network card. do you know what network card you have?
can i just add /dev/hda3 /mnt hfsplus umask=000 0 0
?
basically it's what you want to mount, where you want to mount it, the file system type, options
yep
Monk are you going to try ubuntu?
do the spaces between everything matter?
/192.168.1.3/Donkey
miggumike: yes
err with // in frount
miggumike: as long as there is at least ONE space between each option
hi, any idea which sources to add to apt, to upgrade to firefox 1 and thunderbird 1
miggumike: one space, 3 spaces, 20 spaces, all the same to it
it just needs at least one
i need a good public jabber server. i've had a bad experience with some. any recommendations?
imka, i dont use jabber
whats it like
ska1 have you had a problem downloading and installing?
under <options> should i ass umask=000
add*
?
kergan, imho the best im protocol
miggumike to make it accessable by everyone - yes
alright
imka i use aol,msn(2ce),icq,yahoo
/dev/hda3       /mnt            hfsplus umask=000       0       0
that's what i'm adding
any objections?
nope
looks good
umm
...
after thats done do a sudo mount -a so you dont have to reboot
do you have anything else in /mnt file?
actually if I were you I would actually create a mount point (the /share directory in my case)
miggumike: umask is the reverse of permissions so a umask of 000 = chmod 777, umask of 022 = chmod 755, etc.
or /mnt/share
Yep
yep
I have mine set as /mnt/winders
:)
i put mine in my user dir so i can have easer acess to it
although I don't know why
This install was a case of "let's blow away windows"
like /home/zenrox/mp3s
i can make the directory anything?
/mnt/max0r
?
yep
cool
miggumike: the world is your calciferous bivalve
and i didn't follow what cef was saying.
i not familiar w/ umask and chmod
ya you can do /mnt/life.sucks.dick if you wanted to
lol
/mnt/i.hate.finals
miggumike: you know how file permissions work ?
LMAO
lol
miggumike: man umask, man chmod
/mnt/LMAO
ok
hahahah
i check it out
/mnt/dick
better yet /mnt/puss
lol
heh
I mounted my windows install and I really don't know why.
there is nothing there I want
It feels like my windows install mounts me every day in work
no man for umask.
hell I haven't booted to windows in....
ummmmm
mike998,  i can understand that
damn, does logitech make any linux drivers?
I have to use it... but I don't want to
Crane,  if you cant rember time to blow out win compleatly
I need to
Just to lazy to do it
you will need the time for the new upcoming 3d porn
Marble2,  you dont need drivers for logitec in linux
I was made aware of Ubuntu by a friend who ordered a CD from the site. He assured me that Ubuntu was speedy and light on resources. Can anyone confirm this?
miggumike: chmod is a way of changing permissions. you have 3 groups of access 'User', 'Group' and 'Others'. Each one of these groups can have 'Read', 'Write', and 'Execute' permission.
kergan:  why not
my mouse3 doesn't work for scrolling up and down in firefox
like if I press it in
and other things too
you press it to scroll?
Marble2 mouse3 works differently in *nix
you need to slect a difert protical for your mouse
like if you push in on it
yep it set up in your X config file
where's that?
miggumike: man chmod might help
x config is in /etc/X11 file
ahh
thats for the old xserv
miggumike: about the 6th paragraph down in the man page
the newer one is xorg.conf
bbk
ubuntu uses xorg?
the devel ver of ubuntu
hoary
witch is wot i am using atm
cool
I can't wait to get home and try out ubuntu
Marble2: In windows I miss the middle click to paste.
Crane: ubuntu is awesome
i love it but when i use the xcompmgr it slows down to a crawl
mike me tpp
too
be back in a bit
what is xcompmgr
so the xcompmgr is just used for screen shots
does ubuntu format the drive before an install?
LostMonk: it can
it alows the shadows and fading of menus
LostMonk: only what you tell it to
oh
Crane: i've installed older versions, i want the latest release
ya and turns on the transparicy
I usually turn off bells and whistles
Crane: i've got firefox .93 but latest is v1
so the xcompmgr is just used for screen shots
then
cool
yep
how do i disable a startup service say postfix?
anyone using nvidia card and drivers?
no, that's not what xcompmgr is for
ska1: update-rc.d is the tool you want
Crane: yeah
Crane: i'm using nvidia drivers on a gf4mx igp
ska1: or 'rm /etc/rc2.d/*postfix*'
bob2: thanx
install with no problems?
Crane:yup, went well
cool
O_o
Crane: installed the nvidia-glx deb package
next question, does anyone play quake3 or ut2k?
bob2,  then what is xcompmgr is for then
was there a huge netsplit or something
i have to run that if i want shadows
Crane: I can'
I was made aware of Ubuntu by a friend who ordered a CD from the site. He assured me that Ubuntu was speedy and light on resources. Can anyone confirm this?
t figure out how to get the sound okay in quake 2
help
newb
bob2: well "sudo update-rc.d -f postfix remove" did the trick
nigg yes its speedy and light on resurses
thanks for the response :)
the unbuntu cd and reinstall GRUB loader right?
ska1: right
cause i wanna  install windos xp
nigg: i'm not sure about the light part, though  its speedy and very integrated with good gnome default desktop
mitochondyu,  why install win xp
mitochondyu: usually the accepted way is to install windows then linux if you want to dual boot
ya
anybody running firefox v1 can point me to the apt repository to get it?
ska1 integrated... would there be any issues using Fluxbox or another lighter window manager?
good old microsoft's attitude of wanting to be the only o/s on the hdd
nope
nigg
ska1 its in hoary
perfect :)
ska1: I just downloaded the installer.
Cranes got the right idea
kergan: ok thanks :)
cause i need to use my scanner
that sucks
sane wont detect my scanner
i install xp just to use that
where are system logs stored?
mitochondyu,  you need to install sane for scanners to work in linux
yeah i know
is not supported yet..
wots the scanner
/var/logs I think
EPSON PERFECTTION 2480 PHOTO
thanks crane
else i wont even get near windoes
mitochondyu,  did you check out there site for a dev ver that has support or when thay are going to support your scanner
Crane: is there  a place where like every command i issue is logged?
yeah, one of them support it, and i am not linux guru, is like recompiling the kernal and stuff, too much for me now.
am just a newb
Marble2,  ya use your arrow up key
seriously, is there?
ya
Marble2,
Marble: are you talking about in the console?
well yea
or through GUI
if so just hit your arrow key up or down
but I mean like
forever
after reboots and stuff
and it goes away if I su to a different usewr
-w
mitochondyu,  hmm ya to bad
can someone tell me how i can disable mouse gestures in firefox1.0 packaged with hoary?
so my question is,
can u use unbuntu cd to reinstall GRUB after install windows XP over ubuntu?
that i dont know
make a back up copy of your master boot recoard
Marble2 I'm not sure as far as SUing to a diff user but I just scrolled through mine and found commands from 4 days ago
how to do that?
i have never done that
lol
but is it stored on the system somewhere?
but it can be done
not sure  I'll see what I can find out
mitochondyu.. i have done this with sid...
kergan says, you should back up your MBR and try it
if you want to be very safe
thanks guys i appreciate ur helps..am gonna try this sane cvs...it support my scanner..
screw windows..i am sick of it
lol
spyware of death
and crash for no reason
a clean install wont last few dayz
anyone try longhorn tho?>??
What is longhorn?
longhorn is the next release of windows
but it's still beta
what's longhorn
wont be out till 2006-2007ish
late 2007 is my guess
Marble2: you still here
?
yea
what's there to try about longhorn? i don't understand the hype.
all commands are stored in a file in you home directory
it's just another windows, get over it. "there are no silver bullets."
Windows?
wha file?
it's gonna be the same old same old
/home/your_directory/.bash_history
http://www.lemis.com/~grog/windows.html
billy gives the consumers crap and they close their eyes and swallow it
I think by default it stores only the last 500 commands
does anybody have a radeon 9200 who's running warty?
thanks crane
how do I change it
from 500?
So longhorn is the next release of X Windows?
no prob
socomm: no M$ windows
socomm: no, microsoft windows
beat you rolfzor
mike998: i love my xp. but i will probably never understand the version junkies, whatever os they may prefer.
_jon_ :)
Blackwell: I do actually understand it, and sometimes I am guilty of it
Blackwell: last time I installed xp I got spyware before the installation was finished :)
umm hang on I checking
ok
rolfzor: I have heard that many times... were you firewalled?
what if it's root?
there is no home directory for that
rolfzor: yeah, you have to know what you are doing. besides, some people consider xp contacting time.microsoft.com a proof for spyware in xp.
<tongue in cheek>
Marble2: the home directory for root is /root/
thanks
Marble2: not real sure, type env in your console for a list of veriables
you should see one called HISTFILE=
That is how many commands can be stored
Mine is set at 10000
prak: re: disabling mouse gestures. I don't have it at all, but you might try opening firefox, and in the url bar type 'about:config' and looking thru the options.. double clicking on a line will alter the option
mine isnt there
is anyone using amarok in ubuntu
Whatis amarok?

what tah heck is this?
it wont compile T.T
mitochondyu: first off, don't paste so much in channel
help?
Marble2 you dan't get anything when you type env
oh sorry..
?
didnt know
mitochondyu: s'ok.. now you do *grin*
don't
no
i dont get HISFILE=
HISTFILE
any idea what happen?
rather
seems like nothing compile ever finish
hmmmm
Oh yeah amorok. What about it?
hi! :)
i alwats get segmentation fault
mitochondyu: well, it could be a gcc bug
but sometimes as well, it ends up being a problem with your RAM
mitochondyu,  thay might be in the middel of initizling the status function still
so you might try a memtest86... but usually that's only the case when sometimes it succeeds, and others it fauls
Are you running ubuntu?
T.T all i want is my epson driver, then am all done,
pr your missing something it needs to compile
pr=or
crane, me?
yep sorry
yea
anyone familiar with sane? can i compile just the san epson backend?
i think is the cannon backend causing the error
compile the cannon back end first
then compile all of it
how?
sorry am no programmer eithe r:((
Bleh, this channel sucks.
i have tried to do thangs like that butit never works
lol
i hate compiling..i know its not gonna work..
crap.....
now need to install windows just to use my scanner
wtf.......
are you reading the README that came with it
yeah
./configure
make
make insall
lol
all i knwo..
Marble2: sorry I can't find anything right now.
read the INSTALL
file
hmm..ok
it might have a list of stuff to have installed
That that I found earlier was for redhat
first
Marble2: enter env command again and look for some type of history setting maybe it's named something else.
Why the hell am I sitting here with wwe wrestling on the damn TV
kk
ah fork it..!~
mitochondyu,  just wate
ubuntu will eventualy have that
kergan: there's talk of kubuntu
ewww
kde
lol
lol
actually, I preferred XFCE
i love gnome
and enlightment
does ubuntu support all debian software?
no
but most will install
lol
so they have their own repositories
?
yes but the universe is not supported by ubuntu so you install software from that respotory at your own risk
thay wont help you if it runions your ubuntu
oh
I can't wait to get home and try it.
<--------in hotel out of town working right now
oh
lol
whorey
grumpy whores with warts
whay
what
ubuntu
??
that still dont make sence
I'm getting this strange error when trying to connect to a specific IRC server: http://www.pastebin.com/131803
All other servesr (like this one) are fine
But AfterNet gives that error
Any ideas? =/ I've tried reading the manual, but the manual's all about mIRC and I'm on X-Chat >>
Hikaru79,  conver that manuel to xchat and see what happends
convert
I can't -- the manual calls for changing the e-mail address. X-chat doesn't even ask for your e-mail address o_O;
How is it possible to stream MP3s with XMMS, inside Firefox?
Hikaru79: press ctrl+s and change "User name:" to something in lowercase
Quest-Master,  using like shoutcast??
Sort of
But I'd like to be able to play MP3s inside Firefox
save the .pls file to your hdd
There's no "user name" field, although there is a "Real Name" field, and I changed that to 'adrian' which is all lower-case
and open it in xmms
Without downloading them, or opening a new XMMS instance
Just directly in Firefox.
then get a plugin for firefox
but xmms must be open for that plugin to work
you can minize xmms
Hikaru79: have you connected to it with mirc with no problem?
Hikaru79: try editing ~/.xchat2/xchat.conf, and change "irc_user_name".. its on line 101 here
It could be a server problem
Oh, never mind guys :) The guys in #xchat helped me out
cool
cool
Well I hope you guys don't mind me hanging out even though I'm not using ubuntu
:)
Crane, did you bring beer
Crane, Ubuntu is renowned for it's friendliness ;)
Windoze? Or another Linux distro, Crane?
But, yeah, beer has to be involved, of course.
winshit
Blag ..Fedora based
I'll bring beer tomorrow night
:)
lol
beer is the international language
poor fedora, gets more credit than deserved and less credit than wanted
Actually... i'm under the legal drinking age :(
Drat.
not me
lol
thng the gods
lol
Sorry I like fedora.. or blag rather
Bring Hikaru79 some grape juice
Haha
:)
ok
should be called bloatdora
drinking is so much funnier if you're under the legal age
So where ya from Jason?
rolfzor, true. Especially in Canada. The land of beer :D
Yea I agree about fedora
mmmmmmmmm beer
blag is a stipped down version
1 cd install
but whiskey is a bit more fun
even more fun then fedora
Jager!!!
ooooo pyhton updates
jaeger and gold schlager
python
ok a good question here Whats your very first linux you all used?? mine was redhat 7.2
Redhat 5.2
Hikaru79: is marijuana legal in canada?
suse
redhat 8
redhat 5.2
about 5 years ago
from the book
scoon: me too
rolfzor, not legal, but it has been decriminalized
i used rh for years
then i used gentoo for about 18mos
but i have already ranted about that in therapy this eve
now i use ubuntu
I use clarkconnect as a file/game server at home
it's redhat based
is there something broken with nautilus/file-roller in hoary?
the context menus
no unarchive option
1.4 F
the temp here
jesus
it's around 20 here I think
usual: yeah, it is for me at least.. only "open in file roller"
37f here
-17.6 F with wind
rolfzor, k
-13F without the windchill here
usual: You're a few degrees below us here in Rochester.
I'm in schenectady
:D
its too cold here 57F ;)
I'm in Tennessee right now
grrrrrrrrrrrrr
supposed to get down to 22F on friday
live in Alabama
I hate winter
i'm in texas
I like cold weather
i am in washington state and we dont have snow witch we should have 4-5 feet by now
whee!! its supposed to snow christmas eve
it hasn't snowed here in probably over 10yrs
I'm in ottawa and it was -40F with the windchill today
Aha.
REST OF TONIGHT
PARTLY CLOUDY. COLDER WITH LOWS AROUND 5 BELOW.
LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS.
kergan: http://fredrik.hubbe.net/plugger.html -- this is what I was talking about, wahoo.
I wish it would snow here
holly crap I don't like it that cold
It was supposed to, but it didn't.
and i do?
heh
Quest-Master,  that only works with mozilla 1.7 and not firefox
you got to get the firefox one off the respotores
it's wierd when it's warmer at night than during the day
Oh yeah
They have that one too :)
http://mozplugger.mozdev.org
and it does thats like that but uses totom
for streaming the mp3s
youd have to edit the file for it to open xmms
Hm
insted of totom
and i havent done that yet
anyone know what the url addy is for the preferences for firefox
about: something or other
about:config
just can't remember
thx mike998
np
Hi ppl
hi there
howdy
When I log into KDE in ubuntu it says can not access /dev/dsp
What should I do
ignore it unless you want sound ;)
:)
PD: is your using in the audio group?  (run `groups` from a console)
But I want sound
PD: the first thing is to fire up a console... try cat /dev/dsp > /dev/null
it only says pd when I run groups
what error does it give you ?
ah, permission denied then :)
It says permission denied
sudo adduser pd audio
yea, you need to open /etc/group
er, yea, i guess adduser can do it too :)
i always forget about that, heh
then you need to log out and back in
ok let me try it
PD: while you are at it
do a adduser pd cdrom
adduser pd floppy
adduser pd video
that should be good for most of the common things
Okei I'll log out and come back innnn
aeruder: You should advise him to use the GUI tool available in Computer -> System configuration -> Users and Groups
paulproteus: why?
That way, he'll become acquainted with the GUI tools if he prefers them.
and if he doesn't?
Maybe "advise him to" is too strong; but point him to it as well, at least.
paulproteus: if he had asked how to open a console, i'd have thought about teaching him the gnome-specific way
not that i would even know the gnome-specific way :)
There are a lot of new Linux users I've been talking to who want more GUI tools to do things, even if there's a command-line available.
paulproteus: but in general, the adduser method will work on all distros and perhaps on other os's
paulproteus: and then cripple them when they have to do something with command line?
paulproteus: a little command line never hurt anyone ;)
x is just meant to be a way to run more xterms
calc: thank you!
heh
:)
calc: That's not how lots of users see GNU/Linux, though I do have that position sometimes.
Basically, this is the big advantage of Ubuntu over most other distros: Well-integrated GUI tools.
if dos wasn't a pos the same would be of windows
Hi all, anyone use the ati drivers?
paulproteus: that's not how many see it, but at the same time i don't see the point on teaching a user how to do it the "GNOME" way
and then when they try XFCE they have to fire up gnome to add people to groups
thanks guys its working now
aeruder: So they can feel less like, "Linux is a frustrating experience."
I'm trying to setup laptop mode
or when they try a different distro, they are screwed
gui's are slower than console for most things, of course word processing, web browsing are useful to have a gui
PD: was that in any way frustrating?
hehe
nope that was a cake walk
PD: you're starting a flamewar ;)
unless you like typing docbook directly in vim ;)
(PD: As an aside, you can do this from the GUI, too: Computer -> System settings -> Users and Groups.)
aeruder: maybe *for some people*, the GUI is a path to the CLI ?
Xenguy,  i agree
anyone?  ati drivers?  Hopefully on a laptop?
kergan: some people will *never* take to the CLI (altho I'm not really sure why that is)
I tried installing ubuntu on my friendslaptop but it crashed
i used the gui then started using the cli casue it was more powerfull
Xenguy: *perhaps*... however, with many system conf issues with gui's, they are different from distro to distro, not to mention they are different from desktop to desktop, and then they are different from version to version
so why not teach people the way that will stick around?
i use the regular x.org driver for my 9600 but thats also because there is no amd64 driver at all for it
hey guys, got to go
I tried stoppoing services an all that, finally I gave up
I'll swing in tomorrow night
aeruder: sure, which is why learning the 'low-level' tools is best ;-)
later
cendrizzi: There's probably some info on the forums, but I have no personal experience with it.
aeruder: but I guess in the end it depends on your specific audience at any given time
Xenguy: in my experience, most somewhat-technically inclined people would rather be shown how to do it via the command-line (or even told, hey, you can directly edit /etc/group) than to use some magic gui that is gone when they install redhat
that is why the tools need to be part of the desktop itself not part of the dist
paulproteus, I'm coming here because I'm not getting help there :(
aeruder: I agree - and then there are those who are not 'tekkies', and want the GUI comfort zone
eg g-s-t
cendrizzi: Ah.
calc: yes, and then when they use KDE instead of gnome?
shoot them to put them out of their misery? ;)
aeruder: or perhaps what they think is the comfort zone ;-)
aeruder: It's in the KDE Control Center, actually.
or a slower machine and decide that they want to run blackbox or fluxbox?
Not hard to find.
aeruder: And it's certainly a good idea to teach them the command-line version, too.
paulproteus, It's really dumb, you can setup laptop mode, to toggle between external monitor and lcd but I have no idea how to actually toggle
there is no docs on it
paulproteus: well, *I* for one will not be showing people how to do it via the GUI
the kde admin tools looked pretty bad the last time i looked at them, and aren't nearly as complete
ATI certainly doesn't have any
command line first. gui tools after.
aeruder: No problem. :)
and that is that.. so feel free to interject with how to do it via the GUI
<-- doesn't use gnome/kde ;)
aiui kalyxo is working on fixing the kde tools
i use my seti@home in cli casue its easer to set up that way
calc: Oh, good. :)
would be cool to abstract the backend of g-s-t and just have both gnome and kde frontends to that
'lo all.
high tar`
gnome-system-tools, got it.
I thought you were saying something about gstreamer, calc.
oh sorry, yea gnome-system-tools
calc: the backend is abstracted and there's already a KDE frontend to the network configuration stuff that needs to be investigated
Where has Ubuntu been all my life? :P
tar`: hidden in a pit of tar we call Debian ;)
Riddell: great
the best linux distro!
and I have tried ALOT of them
Now to figure this Tomcat dealie out :P
just tried PCLOS beta8... its nice
wb lostmonk
anyone awake?
yay
did it work
noipe
I'm awake
lol
while i installed, i had a bootstrap error
what happed lostmonk
thats odd
heres my question
hi
didja do a check to see if the iso matched the checksom
i have 2 HD's
the what?
nevermind
hehe
/dev/hda = hdd c
if i install this on my 1 gig, can i take over the 10 gig after i get it working?
/dev/hdb = hdd d
yes
If I've got the correct stuff in "route -n" what could cause me to not be able to ping the router given I connected it up correctly physically too?
you can format the drive and have it mount some whare later
hrm, does ubuntu actually fit in 1 gig by itself
that way i can leave this new install of windows here if i have more issues
yep
lostmonk,
does anyone know the name of the system monitor that looks like just text on you backround
cef: According to the site, it fits in 300 MB if you do it right
ya its called top
yeah kergan?
yep
tuggy1: gdesklets?
i have done that
tar`: yeah expert server install
top? Thanks
Has anyone here been able to install mozilla-mplayer through source?
tar`: that doens't help the average desktop user
quest... I know people have had luck with mozplugger I think
well, if i can get it to install on the small drive, ill reinstall on the bigger if i gotta
i dunno if the iso was bad or what
whats the link for the site?
I had a 1.4 GB drive and by passing the option to tell it not to copy the package files, it fit until I rebooted and began the second half of installation :-\
www.ubuntulinux.org
Not that it's all that important now that I got rid of that laptop. ;)
Has anyone here installed Tomcat in Ubuntu?
warty-release-install-i386.iso
thats what i want right?
There's a bug in the mozilla-dev package so I can't compile mozilla-mplayer for some reason
libpanel-applet2-doc doesn't install actual documentation it seems
*bug in the mozilla-dev package for Debian and Ubuntu
lostmonk,  yes
well, here goes another 20 minutes of downloading
:P
lol
what makes ubuntu better than KDE?
since i have all this time
lostmonk they are too differant things
ubuntu is a distro
kde = gui
i thought ubuntu was just a kind of gnome
kde is a desktop manager/resource hog/everything else they pack in
no
ubuntu uses gnome primarly
gnome is just a desktop manager
as a gui
like explorer is to windows
Well for one thing Gnome seems to use less resources
sorry i am wrong gui = xserver
so ubuntu is more like red hat, etc
yeah
so a sorta "brand"
yeah
yep
but they will all use the same apps?
flavors we call them
prity much
hehe
The second reason is that its philosophy is nice
like i heard about kopete<sp?>
thats for kde desktop
kopete is the kde chat client
does ubuntu have something like that?
gnome has GAIM (better)
ahhhh
gaim= im
so i cant use kde stuff then
ask anyone and they will tell you that
instant messanger
sure you can
gnome has xchat tuggy1
you just need some KDE files
not for IM
lostmonk: you can use kde stuff, if you want
Xchat is for IRC
but they won't be as well integrated into the system as gnome ones generally are
GAIM is for AIM MSN Yahoo Jabber
but does kde stuff cause issues on ubu?
Man, you guys are loud... I need more tolerable Gaim sounds.
lostmonk, not really
not really isnt comforting :P
but the only good KDE app is k3b
Isn't there a FAQ that answers lostmonk's questions? These seem pretty general to me.
i use AIM sounds for gaim.  i got them back when i used my windows partition
im just stuck waiting for the iso to download again
not really means... it doesnt always looks as pritty, might have a bug here or there
mIRC is now the only app on my system
http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?goto=newpost&t=8783
any one else here try Freesbie?
in xchat, what are those two bars below the member list for?
http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/faq/faqfolder_view <- Includes "Do you support KDE?" "Which packages are available in Ubuntu?" etc.
one for lag
not sure about the other
says its a throttle meter
hey can someone go here: http://www.freesbie.org/images/freesbie11-2.jpg and tell me what system monitor that is in the top right
lag and amount transvered
So I guess it's so you don't flood?
that might come in handy if my wife doesn't stop spending my money
no
tuggy1: I saw that earlier today and couldn't figure out what it was either. :)
what is apt-get?
i use gkrellm for my system montor
tuggy1: It looked more elegant in the desktop I saw it in :P
apt-get is the backbone for synaptic.  it's basically the command line interface for downloading and installing programs
lostmonk,  its kinda like rpm -i some.rpm
wow
yep
lostmonk: Do you have previous Linux experience?
i guess i really got a lot to learn
apt-get is the greatest thing ever invented
none
i just reinstall ubuntu(don't ask)
Any alternative OS experience? ;)
ive seen the penguin, and heard stories
but the highest screen res i can get is 1024
haha
Adrenal,  what didja break
before i could get 1152
how do i increase it?
tar: windows

unless i go all the way back to like apple IIe or vic 20
kergan, y?
kergan how did you do that?
tuggy1, it's an X-Chat plugin
sys.all
i got a script from www.xchat.org
Linux CPE000ae62705a3-CM014490004397 2.6.7-2.tmb.6mdk #1 Fri Dec 10 17:50:19 CST 2004 i686 unknown unknown GNU/Linux
somebody?
how do i increase my res?
edit your x conf file
wow uname -a is so informative
kergan, you running hoary?
yep
notice the kernel
ver
Computer > System Configuration > Screen Resolution ?
...
the highest there is 1024
yeah thats what I thought
man hoary is so unstable lol
adrenal: dpk-reconfigure xserver-xfree86.  type that in a terminal and use the defaults.  eventually you'll get to a list of res's
http://dev.gentoo.org/~chainsaw/xsys/usage.html
not for me
how is hoary running for you?
its stable and runs great
youll see
ta
I havent made the switch yet
adrenal: check out the nvidia / ati driver wiki for more info
does 3d nvidia drivers work well?
dpk-reconfigure: command not found
i just did a sysupdate and it still runs fine
am i gonna need a long time to learn all this?
lostmonk,  no
lostmonk, it will come faster then you think
dpkg-reconfigure
just a few weeks if your read the fourms
sorry
just play, break, fix, play, break, fix
yep
looks s  much like i need to learn greek or something
thanks
lostmonk: as long as you're interested, it will come soon
not greek just geek
adrenal: yw
i cant afford to break and fix too often
I've been able to avoid going into the terminal for a lot of stuff, which is nice.
my GF will go nuts
terminal is my fav place... makes things so much faster then waiting for guis
tuggy1,  some times
lostmonk: I installed Ubuntu (Warty) and had a working system without any configuration; plus, with synaptic, you don't even need the terminal to easily install new applications.
lostmonk: the apt-get commands are pretty basic once you catch on
lostmonk: or there's synaptic
tuggy1: I just hate how every time I want to do something new, I have to go learn how to do it. When I don't really care about the internals, clicking a box for DHCP is good enough.
far more supior the the rpm based distros
now, when i had the bootstarp error earlier, it said something about burning the disc slower??
should i do that this time around?
It's worth a shot.
I assume it said your disc was a bad burn?
i gotta dig for my burner app now
tar`, I agree with you there, the one thing ubuntu needs is a control center like yast2 or the one in yoper
lol
yeah, said there was a del bootstrap, something like that
do that you can config certain things quickly
i just like the fast if some thing freazes x(god forbid) it dont take the whole system down like it would with winshit
how do i select something?
what key?
Any sourceforge users around here? I tried registering this morning (twice!) and I still haven't gotten the confirmation letter. It's been about 12 hours already. Is this normal?
Hikaru79,  yes
can take up to 24-48 hrs
I love yoper... I hope they find their way into success, Its one of the few distros that could take me away from ubuntu
i tried to install yoper, but for some reason it wouldn't take to my cpu
what cpu?
what about knoppix?
dell dimension 4800 i think
hmm
p4 2ghz 512mb
no biggie, i love ubuntu
Knoppix can be fun, although *it* doesn't like my system. ;)
yeah I love ubuntu too
I need to stop going to distrowatch
hehe
my GF was wanting to know if there was any kind of windows emulator for running windows apps
i wish i would have found distrowatch earlier in my linux days
it always makes me want to try new distros, only to remeber why I use ubuntu
lostmonk
lostmonk: use winehq
lostmonk, yeah wine
lostmonk,  ya wine
lostmonk: are you trying to wean her off of windows?
but half the time things dont work well so eh its give or take ... why what kind of stuff she wants to run?
i gotta ewan myself off
hey does anyone know if you can use cedega to run win apps other then games?
i have no idea
ask her then
lol
i know shes gonna miss her amarang
:)
lostmonk, there is nothing windows has that linux doesnt, except commercial 3d games
brb
most any thang  thats out for win is eather ported to linux or linux allready has an equilivant
or linux already has a superior
that too
anyone know if hoary will come with reiser4 support?
maybe I should try installing a non game with cedega... see if it works
adbak,  yes
adbak: Is that stable?
IMHO some stuff run slower on linux, like mozilla firefox and most "graphical" apps.
kergan: how do you know that?
i do believe it's stable
reiser4 isn't in a mainline kernel yet
its in the kernel modules list
mozzila runs just fine on linux for me
nictuku, how fast is your comp?
anyone in the SE georgia area need work?
you'd notice the difference if you were on a k6 300 with 128mb of ram :)
Firefox doesn't handle opening zillions of tabs at once as well in Linux as it does in Windows for me.
and I'm even running fluxbox instead of gnome
you should be using vector linux
i'm on a k6 350 with 128mb ram
:)
or DSL
wb lostmonk
they are much better for slow old compters
vector linux?
tar, I agree.
(time to upgrade)
old comps stricktly deli linux
how slow should i burn this copy of the iso?
4x
what is it?
or 16x
i burn my ISOs at like 32x
52x here
no problems
i did burn it at 32x
never miss burn even with my super cheap CDr
i burn mine as fast as the media will go
it depends on the media and the drive
my dvd burner tops out at 32x
i installed werty using a cd-rw disk
some old drives have problems with data cds burnt at high speeds
im just gonna try it slower like it suggested
maybe its these cheap cd's i have
:)
lol
ya or you just got the one bad disk in the bunch
10$ for 50\
it depends on the speed of the processor and amount of ram available, too. I can't burn at 8x or I'd get a buffer underrun.
I paid 5 bucks for my 50 stack of CDr
:)
is there a list anywhere for apps available for ubu?
but I work for a computer store and get them almost at cost
hehe
i wish
i payed 20 for my stack of memorex 100 cd-rs
not too bad
ida done that
lostmonk: yes, but it won't really help you
lostmonk: since it's 12 000 items long
20 for 150 52x cdr
lost.. anything you can find linux source files for will run on ubuntu
ikes
i wouldnt know what to do with linux source files
plus the 8000 apps in the deb repos
lol
you don't need to use source
just to compile it
once you've installed ubuntu, just have a look in synaptic
you don't need to compile anything
i was looking at screenshots for something, and it showed like a weather update thing
bob2, unless you want mplayer
lostmonk,  thats in ubuntu
cool
tuggy1: wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats, please don't spread FUD
i have mine up as we speek
is there something l;ike outlook too?
good
lostmonk: yes, evolution
that was one of my fav things on trillian
instant weather before i left for work
ya its called evolution
lostmonk, do you mean like outlook express?
maybe my gmail will work with that, since it wouldnt with outlook
yeah
thunderbird is good
then its called thunderbird
mozilla.org
lostmonk: gmail works great in evolution
yea it does
good
today my outlook updated for the first time in 3 weeks
:P
bob2, now your stuff before you get on peoples case... there have been problems installing mplayer
lol
will preseeds support be added to the next ubuntu release installer?
tuggy1: er, um, ok
nictuku,  whats that
tuggy1: the only problems I've seen are from people failing to follow the instructions
bob2, true
tuggy1: can you point me to a specific problem so it can be fixed?
well, im gonna try this again here
auto-install, for mass installations.
if i have issues, ill be back again :P
lol
cya
hopefully, ill just be back
if I come across it again.. no problem
nictuku: some people are working on it for d-i in debian, I imagine there's still tiem for it to make it into hoary if it's stable
and its not FUD
nictuku,  probly not
it is FUD
since the packages work fine for thousands of people
bob2, call it like it is man
but we can also add that they are unsupported and not even in the ubuntu repos
no, we can't
since mplayer is in multiverse
if when hoary releases the d-i is still "rc2", will it ship it?
mplayer rocks, even if a few people can't follow directions..
mplayer does rock
nictuku: warty shipped with d-i from before the first beta, iirc
gxine is a competent replacement for mplayer
is anyone from GA?
i think xine is better the mplayer
rc2 has a pretty decent preseeds set.
best player for linux that I have used
but to each hisOR her own
SimonTek: the user list is probably a better place for questions like that
so where is that list guys
xine is better than mplayer?
no
yes
they're both pretty much equivalent
Whats that weather thing called that Lost spoke about
no, IMO.
I am curious if anyone wants to submit a resume. thats all
its in your add idam to your bar
burner: not necessarily.  depends on your tastes
eh... i like mplayer's interface... that's about it
Roshbo: evolution used to be able to show weather forecasts.  theres a gnome panel applet for it now
they both play about the same stuff
SimonTek: yes, I know, try the list
vlc is actually really nice too
tks
SimonTek: the odds of finding any significant number of people from one specific state ine one random country at any time in here is small, compared to the list
i had problems with vlc, forget what they were
true
being lazy.
lol
SimonTek,  if i lived thare id sumit one but i am lazy
lol
ohh there's a stock ticker too...cool
yea, finding people to do work for money ...
people don't want to talk about working for a living...
Err:508
I know you.
ok I have a question... if I installed mplayer from source can I use the mozzila-mplayer from marrilatt?
i think.
tuggy1: you should be able to
tuggy1, in my experience, the mozplugger works better
thats what I have heard
where can I get mozplugger?
do I need to install from source
it should be in the deb repos
should be on the universer respotory
kergan, thanks
your welcome
but i dont
do I need to configure mozplugger at all?
or should it just work
it should just work
yea, what kergan said
it should just work ootb
it should work
and work well
ok Im going to try some videos
even can go full screen with quicktime trailers from apple
sounds good
the other one worsk just fine for even realplayer files and quick time
realplayer as long as rp is installed
where do I get rp? is it part of win32codecs
or the mplayer win codecs?
it's its own pkg
i wonder if there are many people successfully using ubuntu in complex servers..
http://ubuntuguide.org/ <-- go here it will help you install it
oh you mean realplayer its self
I rather die
step buy step
lol
most people here are desktop-only users, it seems..
helix works for some of the rp feeds
easy install
healix rp same thang
except the license
imho, helix is the one redeeming feature of Real
yep
Err:508
anyone still putting .rm files online needs to be shot
hehe
twice
yea, rm sucks
Heh hi again ^^;  Umm im trying to install TinyFugue and when I ./config it get this:  checking for gcc... no checking for cc... no.  configure: error: no acceptable cc found in $PATH.  Might I ask what I have to do about this?
then shot once more
OMG video files in mozilla!!!
hehe
lol
sweet
Dko: you did install gcc, right?
Good night!
kergan, then fed to the bugblatter beast of traal
yep
lol
g'night,m tar`
you mean helix doesn't require you to hand over your first, second and third born to real software? way to go, real, we are so proud of you. :)
right
i love that radio program and books and movies
Blackwell,  dont we all
anyway to control the movies in mozplugger?
15 mil ppl hitting on e company and it got out of businness
nope
kergan: real software is out of business? yay team! now let's move on to sco.
lol
and netware
so I cant fast forward through this SUPER CRAP XXX state of the union trailer
ttoo
Could someone help me with my  TinyFugue install problem?
NOOOOO!!!!!!
Dko: hm. is that software in any way related to the "brainf*ck" programming language?
tuggy1, let me find out what mine does now... it did have the controls
when the star of a movie doesnt come back for the sequal you know its bad (specially when they replace them with ICE T)
the mplayer file... let me find it
Oo
Blackwell: If you being serious. I have no clue.
Dko: half serious. that language actually exists. :)
dear god allmighty
lol intresting
is that what they write windows in?
this is ridiculous
tuggy1: some call c and c++ that kind of language, i guess.
cause when ever I use it I feel like im getting "brainf******"
Dko: have you installed build-essential?
couldnt retrieve bsdmainutils. This may be due to a network problem or a bad cd.
there are a few others like that. invented to be as horrible as possible.
I don't think I have.  Cause I havn't heard of that beffore
now, when it come to the network config part right in the begginning
omg
it says it cant find a network
<--- hates being a linux newb ><
asks if i wanna set it up static or something
i just byapss the step, could that be the problem?
Dko: install it through synaptic and try again
how is you net configured in win
i have no clue
go look
it just does it all automatically
what am i looking for?
if it uses static routing or dhcp
Can you all recommend a stable IRC client for someone (me) who uses IRC like once a month but is scared by XChat?  I currently uses Mozilla's Chatzilla on Windows.
hmmm I need for programs open
rolfzor: Alright.  Just let me see if I can find
dhcp
hmm it might not reconize your nic card then
i have a garbage integrated nic
ChrisC_: you can use chatzilla on linux
ChrisC_: chatzilla runs on linux too
ChrisC_: what scares you about xchat?
lostmonk,  then thats wot it is
lostmonk, do you have a 3com laying arount
Hmmm, I installed Mozilla but the CZ button isn't there ...
nope
i have no extra stuff
lostmonk: did your cd burn correctly?
lostmonk,  any network card
dunno
i had an error at a different part than last time, so i dunno
bob2 it worked just says cant find network
ChrisC_: you have to install the mozilla-chatzilla package
kergan: that's not answering my question :)
Aha!
lostmonk,  it is a good burn this time
I should be back in a minute with a different client :)
i dunno
what are some good program recommendations for stealing files? I mean sharing files
bob2,  it worked casue it errors out at the network setup part of the install
rolfzor: Yes that worked.  Thanks ^^
id assume it was
like with gnutella or edonky
i burned at half the speed as the 1st time
kergan: no, that doesn't mean the cd is ok
kergan: that's a sign that the cd is *not* ok
Dko: np
bob2,  not in my expereance
but ok
lostmonk: can you run the "check cd" step?
tuggy1: nicotine is great for music
(its a soulseek client)
is there a way to see if my hardware just is not supported?
lemme check
tada!
not that i see
thanks rolf
any others?
its nero
lostmonk: check out http://www.linuxcompatible.org
I apoligize in advance for the n00b questions I'm about to ask.  I know unix systems (work in QNX all day long) but need help getting my bearings in my new Ubuntu installation ...
s/apoligize/apologize
lol
I have a basic Ubuntu Warty install ...
Recommend a CPU/memory status tracker?  Like something that resides at the bottom of the screen somewhere.  Ubuntu approved, of course.
as long as its green, its compatible, right?
ChrisC_: gnome has a system monitor applet
ChrisC_: right click on the panel -> add applet -> system monitor
chrisc_: gdesklets?
gkrellm is a far sepior systom monter
and takes up far more space and cpu
true, on both counts
OH NO!! Im only using 152 megs of ram
bob2,  not to bad if you keep all the plugins out of it
this so sux
but i cant stop form playing with the plugins
OK, really stupid question:  "right click on the panel"  where?  I tried ...
anyware
anywhere on the bare panel
ie not on another applet
beed more apps running
hmmm, mozilla buttons in the way, must learn how to size those ...
I want to know if my swap partition works
the grey bars at the top and bottom of the screen
damn linux and it s good memory managment and non resource hogging applications
lol
tuggy1, if you are logged in then it is working
hehe
i have 516mbs of ram and i havent even tuched my swap yet
OK, still lost ... "bare panel" ... oh CHRIST you meant the thing at the TOP of the screen.  I was clicking around the taskbar at the bottom ...
I have never had anything more to swap yet
i have even made my swap 128mgs
bingo!
should i try to get like a barebones install of linux first or somthing?
I have a gig for swap
ChrisC_: that is also a panel, but it doesn't have any free space
lostmonk: have you tried to do the default install?
what do you mean?
12 windows open so far... no slow down!! this thing must be broken, its missing the bullettime application load features of windows
hmmm, as soon as I installed the System Monitor panel, the mouse got jumpy
what are you trying to install/configure?
removed it -> mouse smooth again
tuggy1, if you add the mplayerplug-in with mozplugger installed you get the controls in the mozilla player window
i restart with the cd in
and it never gets past base install
lostmonk: have you checked the cd burnt correctly yet?
mplayerplug-in?
ive reburnt it once already
yea
tuggy1: what's sad is that this 333MHz machine should be capable of that.. but linux is paintfully slow on it.
is your cd-drive reliable?  i had trouble installing ubuntu on this comp but that was due to a faulty cd-drive
calamari, did you mod hdparm?
lostmonk: no, that's not the same
never had issues with it before
lostmonk: check that the CD burnt correctly
how?
to speed up the HD access speeds
nomasteryoda: dunno.. not sure what that means :)
lostmonk: select 'check cd' from the installer menu
oh
or use md5sum on it
why wont this computer slow down!!!!
installer menu on the cd?
hmm, it's the network component of the System panel that causes the jumpy mouse.  I wonder if that's a warning of network trouble (brand new install)
tuggy1: chill dude
246mb of ram used
sorry
lostmonk: try installing ubuntu again, but instead of hitting enter after your computer boots up, type 'custom-expert'
ok
look at this article... http://enterprise.linux.com/article.pl?sid=04/12/14/166253&tid=89
then what?
for hdparm
er, the url that is
nomasteryoda: thanks, I appreciate that :)
then you'll have a list of options that you can use to check the cd or install various parts of ubuntu
lostmonk, look at sudo lspci
ah, ok
sudo what?
sudo lspci   - lspci lists pci hw
I should get a screen shot of this when Im done
and what with the md5sum thing am i looking for?
that the md5 matches for the iso
dunno how
nero has that option too... pretty sure of that
i have done it, but since i have used k3b for the past year, i have forgotten windows junk ...hehe
ya me too
k3b is the kde cdburning app
heheI opened all off the standard ubuntu apps that are installed normally
calamari, if you mod the hdparm, first do the dma option then if it is stable, try something more daring
i have old nero soo
with minimal kde crap installed
yea
only using 381mb of ram
hmm.. im using 700mb running only xchat, thunderbird, firefox, gaim, and some terminal windows
wow mroth... youve got to be kidding
lostmonk, look here
http://www.fastsum.com/press/md5-hash.php
according to resource monitor anyhow
OK, next n00b question:  when I do some action requiring root, what governs whether I get a password prompt for that action?  It seems to be remembering the root password sometimes (i.e. no PW prompt)
are you compiling in the background?
that should get you going on a windows burn
what are your stats coming from/
nope
and free
from gnomes system monitor
maybe it uses more because I have more total
(2gb installed)
ChrisC_, if you su to root, then you just need the password when suing, then you are root.  if you use sudo then it remembers it and sometimes it just doesn't require a password (at least it can be set up that way)
yeah I only have a gig installed
firefox has a VM size of 120MB :/
haha wtf trashapplet has a vm size of 27.3mb
CheatersRealm, ChrisC_ also note the option to open a root terminal
how many tasks running?
which requires only entering sudo password once
I have 143
ChrisC_: or you can always use the root terminal: Applications -> Sys Tools -> Root Termina
why on earth does an icon of a trashcan need 30 megs of ram
let me do a test to see if I can come up with a testcase to illustrate what I mean ...
i have 150 running and still only takeing  2/3 of my ram
90 tasks total
I am really considering running ubuntu
yeah my trash take 24mb
kergan how much ram?
516
CheatersRealm, Ubuntu rocks
I have every gnome game launched right now :)
adbak: actually, that's what's driving my question:  why don't I get a root PW prompt when I try to open a root terminal (it just opens)?
nomasteryoda, I figured I might get that response here :)
i get this error right at the boot process saying that VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev hda6.
chris there is no root
it uses gksudo
this is because its an reiserfs
cryptomatt: do you even use ext3?
so it asks for your password
no i dont
well there you go ;)
tuggy1: I know :) so what do you want to call the root terminal :)
how can i prevent it from trying to read a ext3
ChrisC_, if you used sudo within 5 min then it acutally keeps your status as "sudo"
i mean it just slows up my boot
nomasteryoda, how do i use that?
the checker?
nomasteryoda: aha!  first prize!
burber: ??
yeah
thanks
what is ubuntu's package management system's name?
umm it should be called the sudo terminal
apt
CheatersRealm: synaptic?
CheatersRealm: apt
nomasteryoda: is that configured somewhere?
aight, thx
but it is in full root use mode
CheatersRealm: APT - Advanced Package Management
VFS: Can't find ext3 filesystem on dev hda6.
VFS: Can't find ext2 filesystem on dev hda6.
am I the only one here that has a root file manager?
it tries ext3, then it tries ext2 then settles for reiserfs
how can i make sure it just tries reiserfs upfront
the sudo timeout?
crypt, they talked about this on the forums
search there
lostmonk, just download and install the program on windows ...
adbak, I know what APT is, maybe not what it stands for, but over the past few years, I've learned the power of the google
then check the iso md5sum
with it
:)
tuggy1: i will try that
cryptomatt: if you find out... enlighten me ;)
CheatersRealm: don't forget http://www.apt-get.org
OK, next question, this one's a bit tougher and longer to ask ...
i'm curious as well
bur[n] er, about?
I want to just test out the 3D performance of my new machine (my first one wiht any kind of 3D hardware) ...
nomasteryoda: about the ext3 vfs error on boot when using reiser
I downloaded the doom3-demo but it won't run ...
ChrisC_, what kind of card, memory, etc
nvidia is generally the best out there
chris have you tried glxgears
ChrisC_, can you run glxgears?
I installed the nvidia drivers and it goes to X but then falls to a lower resolution version of my desktop with mouse frozen in upper left corner; Ctrl-Alt-Backspace recovers
i have 256mb and it runs well
to make sure you got 3d
burner: i think it has to do with the boot image.. i think this particular boot image assumes a ext based FS.. settles for reiserfs eventually.. perhaps kernel will need to b recompiled?
glxgears:  glad to, synaptic?
nope
just type it into a term
running now!
what's it's fps?
how many fps?
if it bumped back to lower res, then nvidia is not running... you get a splashscreen for nvidia then the login
haha tuggy1
lol
where does it display the fps
I think back in the terminal
in the term window
damn
hey
oh, yeah ... 1300 fps
ChrisC_, some of the screensavers are GL, so they can also display fps
2000
thats not bad
ok, does ubuntu have redhat-like config scripts for the services like apache?
MSI FX5700LE
so 3d works for ya
umm what does doom 3 do when you run it?
tuggy1: agreed :)
ChrisC_, have you tried bzflag?
anybody know anything about Synaptic's repositories?
CheatersRealm: rcconf ?
also 3d
nu-unxsaint: yes
It goes to a graphical startup screen, but after a few seconds bails out to the hosed screen I described above
lemmee try it again
bur[n] er_, ok, that's part of it, will I have to edit the config scripts manually if I want apache to run a certain way?
ChrisC_, make sure dvi and glx are in the XF86Config file
oh wait, I can't, it'll kill this session ...
lol
CheatersRealm: how do you want it to run?
three key smash!
/etc/apache/httpd.conf ?
nomasteryoda: OK, I'll look ...
ChrisC_, turn on the logging in xchat so you can save the sessions
bur[n] er_, right, so there's no systemwide configuration utilities? (i've used gentoo so I know how to do it, and I also have used fedora which does it all bascaily for you)
very handy sometimes
CheatersRealm: does what?
nomasteryoda: I'm actually using Chatzilla, I'll evolve to a better IRC client some day :)
lol
ok
bur[n] er_, like, they help you set up the servcies, not just the runlevels, but they actually do the configs
xchat is on ubuntu warty disc
I don't have a 'thing' I want to do now, it's just I wanted to know if ubuntu rolled it's own config utils
rcconf is it
afaik
ok, thanks
cheat.. it has all the debian config utils i think
I've never used deb.
how much do they do?
CheatersRealm, you can also use webmin
umm they should do just about everything?
my /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 file has a Load "glx" but nothing about dvi
CheatersRealm, there are many 1000s of packages for deb
ok, cool
ChrisC_, oops ...
meant dri
type
o
ok, yeah, that's in there
does it also have nvidia as the Device driver
in that file
tell me where to look :)
hmm anyone know good programs to use for either edonkey or gnutella?
Section "Device"
yes
ok
sounds good then
and the identifier matches
good
OK, let me just try it and I'll be back
so looks ok from that aspect
ChrisC_, look at
lsmod
oops
missed him
anyone use mldonkey?
nope just limewire
looks like its just what Im looking for
azerus here
yeah, it died
ChrisC_, lol
look at
lsmod
btdownloadcurses.py !
yeah I use azeruas
to see if nvidia driver modules are loaded
(that + screen)
mldonkey died?
CheatersRealm, lol
azureus even
yep
azureus rocks
cool
nomasteryoda, actually, that's what I use, my college blocks bt, so I dl from home over ssh
good stuff... just slow... abc is supposedly making a 2.7.0 release for linux soon
lol
it's python based... so faster than azureus :)
college blocks bt?
how? you can use any port you want
bur[n] er_, packet shapers
ssh is the way to go
wow
impressive
yeah
well it doesn't stop us
big sucker, too:  "nvidia   4821428  12"
yea
sure it is
but it is the best video set out there
Oh, no arguments ...
gnite
nite
if anyone wants a gmail invite
first 10 to ask me get them
just msg me
so anyway, I start of the doom3-demo, it goes to a splash screen, then bails out to show what appears to be a 640x480 chunk of my desktop, non functional
are there drivers for the GForce 2 agp card >2yr old in ubuntu?
trombie, arn't they the same as the newest ones?
ChrisC_, are the other modelines in your XF86Config file?
trombie, yeah
sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
i dunno
including that resolution?
trombie, theres no difference
You use the same instructions as people with brand new cards.
thinkin about tryin linux for awhile
nomasteryoda: oh boy, I get to remember all that old Xconfig stuff again ...
yea
if you have the drivers then i would mostly guess the issue is with resolutions
i hate that part of x
is always problem
OK, there are several modelines, one for each color depth, each with plenty of resolution options including 640x480
crud
OK, so how about recommending another simple game that I can use just to see my 3D card do something :)
windows <duck>
zing!
bzflag
hehe
is cool and worldwide play
any luck, lostmonk?
im reburning it again
http://armagetron.sourceforge.net/
if this dont worjk
im throwing the damn system out the window
gltron is good way too
freakin BS
lol
http://tuxracer.sourceforge.net/
ive gone thru 5 cd's
those are a couple nice open gl games
its 130am
this is just ridiculous
bzflag is sweet
tuxracer!
im going to linux to lose problems
lostmonk: you are? bwaahahaha
lol
lostmonk, once you get going ... it is very sweet
linux does not help against stupidity
like a whole new universe has opened up to you
yeah well, i cant take many ore headaches form this
oooh... ouch, sorry ;)
yeah, after you have solved all the problems it is very nice. (replace "it" with whatever gives you problems :)
stfu
just playin mate
bbiab
trying to figure out bzflag ...
oh yea?
is there a practice mode?  I assume if I join a server I will be ripped to pieces :)
just enter a username you want, then an email address .. bogus works
no
noobs are ok
try one of the ducati style ones
or spirals
is fun
tab for jump
right mouse for flag release
left to fire
you'll live
OK, n00b question: how do I jump out of that app and back to my regular desktop?  Alt-Tab didn't do it ...
have to quit using esc
at the lower left of the screen, you'll see a button.  click it
then arrow down to quit
nm
adbak: talking about being in a fullscreen game ...
so did it work ok
most fullscreen games are keyboard only to login/out
ChrisC_, which server?
OK, that was fun
which server:  heck if I know :)
hehe
Spirals is cool
so your GL is working fine...
good
sorry
back again ... see, it's the simple things in life (tuxracer)
yeah, GL seems to work :)
don't know what's up ID's butt
tuxracer is nice
yea... google lists some others with same issue
synaptic is just too damn easy
lol
ChrisC_: use dpkg then :)
LOL
dpkg --force-all is nice
try using suse's yast and synaptic together...hehe
LOL
just ask daniels ;)
ChrisC_, make sure you don't
lol
this is just dumb
4 cd's, all freezing at different points
wtf?
back again, this time dizzy from armageTRON
wheeee!
OK, it's a quarter to 2am, time to go
Thanks nomasteryoda for your help, I'll probably be back tomorrow with more serious tasks :/
or he'll still be up playing bzflag...
is there anyone here that truly knows this damn thing all the way thru?
lostmonk: what thing?
this damn distro
uhh..
everyon has such great things to say about it
but the damn thing wont work
heya, is there a way to use the live CD as a rescue CD? I"ve not been able to find it so far.....
or amybe the mirror i used has a bad iso?
hm...I'm guessing that the lovely bluecurbve for debian package on themes.freshmeat.net doesn't come with the kde style packaged...considering running alien on FC's package...
cuz i have burned thru 4 damn cds
lostmonk, you've lost me.  I'm running ubuntu right now.
lostmonk: do an md5 sum?
sure your download is good?
I've tried my best to break it, too, I really have.
its freezes at different points everytime
do you burn .iso files the right way
on every cd
yeah
ive burnt them plenty
md5sum it?
m eh
it did a verify and no issues
i downloaded a diff app to burn it just for a verify
hi
Hello all - pretty crowded here!
lostmonk: i mean the download!!!
not the burn
how do i md5 the dl?
if the burn verifies fine... great, but if you're burning crap, who cares
lostmonk: u in windows?
yeah
get a lil program called "dsmd5"
verify the md5sum with the sum posted on the ubuntu website
nevermind, brain in nuetral
i have no idea how to use this thing
drag and drop the .iso onto the md5 program
okay
it will calculate an md5 sum
it's a way to verify a file downloaded is the same as the file on the server
nothing happened
where is the sum on the site?
got it
they match
now what?
ive never had an issue with a cd before now
and ive used 3 apps to burn the cd
damn
i was hoping they wouldn't ;)
on that note... i have no idea
shitty media?
or maybe ubuntu doesn't like some of your hardware
i dunno
i burned 1 copy at 2x
i had no issues
so then what else can i try?
where can i find a different distro?
one that works already
i'm having problems upgrading from warty to hoary, i get errors updating console-data
Ubuntu does not seem to like something on my P4.   Downloaded and burned and can install on a P3 but installer hangs just as it displays the prompt to select the language for install on my P4.  No keyboard response. Ideas?  Can't switch to another console to view output even when i set debug options for boot.
is your keyboard broken?
;)
fjordlander: usb keyboard?
distrowatch
nomasteryoda ??
what about?
ps2 keyboard not broken
NEWS FLASH! PS/2 KEYBOARD NOT BROKEN!
And Thats Not All!!!!!
lol
:-D
For $2 more you can have a mouse not broken too!!!
hrm, i'm installing ubuntu on a mates computer, and it keeps freezing on "load hotplug system" or something like that..
anyone know what's up with that?
hehe
i just had it freeze on me in 4 spots, with 4 different burns of the cd
i can't seem to get around it...  recovery mode still does it, and init=/bin/sh doen't work cause it's a usb kb
im moving on
seems i just cant install it myself
Hmm... I am freezing with a ps2 keyboard on a P4 Mobo with radeon card at choose language for installer stage
crazney, have you looked at dmesg?
Zotnix, nah
Zotnix, can i login at that stage?
Well, you can look at it once you log in.
I have set installer to full debugging but since it freezes at the the point it has just initiated framebuffer, I can't see debugging data
but it's freezing during init..
Ah, ew
Installs fine on a P3.  Also I know stock debian will install without this issue
over here now
craz_laptop, so you can
ack
so you can't boot up at all?
well it freezes on 'starting hotplug subsystem'
i can't swithc virtual terminals
at that stage
Does it time out or it never goes on?
never goes on, it seems
ha
Zotnix, any idea how to get around it?
craz_laptop, did some googling. Not really sure.
hrm, just tried some random boot cd my mate had lying around, it froze on the hotplug stuff too
hi
What kind of hardware do you have on there?
Zotnix, hrm, xp3000+, usb kb/mouse.. standard other stuff
Which live CD do you have burned?
hmm, Xorg feels a lot slower after the recent updates :/
slax i think
and it's a shuttle pc
I meant the Ubuntu
warty-i386.iso ?
oh
Or something like that?
4.1
i can't find a hoary cd, is that right?
warty-release-install-i386.iso
Did you get that one?
he thinks so
I have 3 lan cards, eth0 eth1 (network) are sis and eth2 (internet) via. I had setup only eth2, how can I bring up eth0 and eth1? (I would like to setup a gateway using firestarter and I failed ifconfig)
Which is a 64 bit processor... I THINK (if it doesn't work don't kill me) you need to get the amd64 release
nah, it's not a 64bit cpu
ahha!
usb keyboard it was
Oh
Odd.
XP3000 isn't 64 bit?
nah
Damn... I was off
What kind of keyboard?
usb keyboard.. laptop layout..
it says inki 1 on it
89 keys
Never heard of it.
yeah either
once i finalise the setup nstuff i can get a dmesg output for you, if you like.
hrm, ok another problem.. nforce 2 network drivers, they don't ship do they?
hey adnans
hi
I am contemplating getting hot-chocolate
should I?
hot grits, better
lol
I wish
RuffianSoldier go get it and bring some
now I want Waffle house
ill dcc you some
:)
modprobe forcedeth     can try that
My alsa sound doesn't work.  Where do I start trying to get that working.  I know it worked under alsa in gentoo, so why is it claiming no cards found?
oh damn, I usually don't like Walmart but, http://media.linspire.com/howto/walmart.swf
and this sounds pretty good too, http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/28447/index.html
morning
bah, that's crud
you can spend a little bit more and get a much better machine from the same place (walmart)
have you seen the flash though
it's killing me, penguin all over the place
Linspire is like a commercial version of Ubuntu with KDE, I like how there logo are these cheesy people running, it's like bottle of vitamins
it's always funny on how they rename sh!t to there own too
I bet some kid is going to get this for Christmas and feel like I felt back in 83' when I got a intelevision instead of a Atari 2600.
someone here makes the theme xfce-dusk  ... who is it?
ChibiFs?
remi
Hello.. anybody got any ideas about a Mentor/Mercury serial modem with conexant chipset compatibility with Ubuntu?
Si quelqu'un parle francais : A l'installation de Ubuntu, on ne m'a pas demande de mot de passe pour root Comment le defini maintenant ?
remi: #ubuntu-fr ;)
merci
I am trying to setup zope/plone on my new ubuntu setup. Can anyone help?
morning
does ubuntu powerpc have wireless support?
zenlunatic, i think it has support for the airport cards but not airport extreme
and i would imagine it supports pcmcia cards that it supports under x86
but don't quote me on that ;)
cool i think i found a good distro
can't speak about it on ppc hardware yet
at least until i steal my brothers new iBook on xmas day ;p
yeah well debian requires the 3rd iso for wireless-tools
but its been on my viao laptop for 2+ months now
which is the longest a linux distro has stayed on here
these faqs are frustrating
GOD
they dont explain anything
zenlunatic, it will be easier to install with a wired net hookup
but i did install with out
people how do i switch to console mode from like uhm animated mode?
like using commands
and not your cursor and such things.. . .
today is my first time back on #ubuntu since like the end of october i think, so i'm a little out of the loop
but the box has been running smooth in the intervening period, updates have worked good
i did manage to somehow lose my wep key week and a half ago though
but i'm certain that was me
xskoulax: can yo usee this?
yea
oh i thought people cant see my messages
sup martin_
everyone seems to ignore me for some reason
*sigh*
could you help me out a lil?
i'll try
but i'ma n00b
i might know what you need though
do you know how to switch to console mode?
you know, like windows has dos
this has some other thing
you can click on applications > system tools > terminal
that would bring up a "dos box"
in windows terms
cool
and i can use that to do whatever i like?
i mean, it has effect?
ctrl+alt+f1-f6 will also bring up command line and you would use ctrl+alt+f7 to get back to the Graphical interface
well martin_ you can do anything a normal user can
to do root stuff in ubuntu you use sudo
what is root stuff?
more detail on sudo is where i would be starting to get out of my depth
root is the admin account on linux
ok, and sudo?
sudo is a way of accessing root account commands from your account
alright... umm
most linux's force you to have a root and a normal account
whats the best way to learn about this system?
this is my first tiem with linux... took me an entire day just to install it.. i had lots of weird problems
playing with the terminal?
martin_, stick with it; when you get things working you get a nice warm fuzzy feeling ;)
yeah im sticking with it, i like this much more than windows
terminal would be the dos equilivent
www.linuxquestions.org is a good forum for general linux stuff i've found
skoul
ah cool
say, how do i get windows to boot whenever i like and ubuntu to boot whenever i like without windows taking over?
ciao!
martin_, you need to install windows before installing ubuntu
hi ^^
i thoght so
otherwise it will overwrite the area ubuntu needs to boot
hi massi :)
man
windows is a bitch
ubuntu and linux in general isn't as arrogant :p
so tell me please, how do i set things?
set things?
i mean
lets say i format
and install windows... and then i go and install ubuntu
then i can decide how to devide the partitions?
without ruining the windows installation?
well..i'm trying to use a picodisk (usb mass storage)..i've done mount /dev/sda .. but into /dev/ i haven't /sda .. what can i do ?_?
sorry massi thats like chinese to me :/
i still havent figured out how to listen to music -_-
martin_, ^_^ understood
martin_, the best solution if you can is to use another computer for learning linux that way you can't hose you windows install
if thats not possiable i'd prefer to use 2 seperate harddrives to keep things seperated
skoulax, dont have another computer :/
thought that might be the case
thats a pretty good idea.. i wonder where i could get another hard drive though, im short on cash
Unless it's essential, usually the best way is to just go straight linux and boot off windows.
That way you force yourself to learn.
there is less risk of messing up important work with stuff on seperate hard drives
ctd has a very good point
yes, ctd does ^^
i guess it depends on what you need your computer for
well finally i found some people who answer my questions
i was getting really frustrated
if your are a gamer going pure linux could get frustrating fast
oh... cause i am
although i havent been gaming in the past week at all
but if you need a stable computer for email word processing and internet you really can't go wrong with linux
i could stop quake3ing for a while i suppose :)
quake3 works on linux
\o/
cooooooooooooooooool
how can i get it up and running?
i dont understand jack shit about all these packages
i've got it working on the slackware install i did for my brother waaaay back
i dont even know what a package is
package is like a zipped program kinda
except in ubuntu and indeed other debian distributions you have a nice program called apt-get
it downloads the program and anything else it needs to run
and will install it too
where can i get it?
it?
the apt get
its installed on ubuntu by default
oh o_o
how do i run it then
martin_: use synaptic, it is a gui front-end for apt-get
?
yea
sub has a point there
i use synaptic too
great program
is it included in ubuntu also?
yea
whats a front end btw
like a skin?
kinda
apt-get is like a dos command
ok.. how do i run it then?
oh i see
and front end is the graphic version
yea
martin_: Computer->System Configuration->Synaptic
cool :)
those menus should be at the top of your screen
martin_,  you have ubuntu running now?
yes
or you here on a windows install
its the only things installed
ahhhh
ok then so you already have have the battle done ;)
i dont really wanna install windows to be honest
:
)
man installing ubuntu was frustrating
it took me more than a day
martin_: just hang around irc, ask questions, you'll be pro in no time
my cd burner didnt work, my HD was connected wrong and lots of shit
martin_, don't worry about it its like learning a new language
cool sub
you only get profecient by using it
yeah xsouklax, only thing i need is a way to learn it
but #ubuntu pretty much serves that need :)
its a good place to start
www.ubuntuforums.org is the english language forum for ubuntu
cool thanks
and don't forget google
and it looks like they have a guide that i didn't know about http://ubuntuguide.org
google knows all
google is godlike :)
google > *
true, true.
ok im gonna try to use synaptic
brb
wow
i have like a million packages
yea there are all kinds of programs
all these programs are installed?
and that would just be with the default repositories
seems so. i thought i didnt have anything
no not all of them
oh, i have them though?
those are the programs you can get from the default repos.
repos = ?
its like a laundry list of the programs those repos. know about
repositiories
repositories
and repositories are?
hehe
a place to get software
oh ok
xskoulax, which program do i need for quake 3 to run?
oh, wait , before that - how can i get bittorrent to run?
you need to download the installer from id's website.
well you would need to get 3d drivers installed first
hello everyone...i'm having a headache with "jack"..does anyone know anything about "jack"
?
karlos, i don't know jack ;P
groan
for bittorrent: sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui
i'm trying to run ardour
agrajag, could you be more newbie-friendly and specific please? :)
it's to do with sound
martin_: open a terminal
run that command I gave after the colon
alright brb
applications > system tools > terminal
close synaptic first.
ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/linux/linuxq3apoint-1.32b-3.x86.run <<< quake3 for linux
all you need if that and the quake3 cd
well and 3d drivers for your graphics card :p
hey beyond - do you like soup?
agrajag it says unable to lock the administration directory
is another process using it?
something liek that
martin_: I said to close synaptic first.
oh oops :)
agrajag, if i press ctrl+alt+f1 its like terminal right?
RuffianSoldier, what are you talking about ?
well yes, but it's usually better to just run a terminal in X
applications > system tools > terminal
alright
beyond - do you know what soup is?
yeah
RuffianSoldier, no I don't
YOU SHOULD TRY IT!
google soup
sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui
er
e: couldnt find package
ok...I'll take a look
Agrajag, martin_ is on a new install
might he need repos for that
aw crap, that stuff's in universe?
yes.. my first time using linux in general
martin_: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
er
actually
martin_: sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
Agrajag, you can prolly guide him better than me
gedit should be easier to use
there should be instruction in that file on enabling "universe"
alright.. whats universe?
martin_, if you type alt+f2 you can get a run box
it's a set of package sthat are not in the standard ubuntu distribution
you can paste that command there if you need
to open gedit on that file
oh coooooool
finally im learning how to do something :)
\o/
so the sudo gedit stuff is actually connecting to some server and downlaoding things from it?
huh
no
no
oh.
gedit is like notepad
it's editing a text file on your computer
oh lol
why would i want to do that then?
right now i mean, concidering i want to downlaod bittornado
to enable the universe repository.
oh ok, ill read it then
brb
You ned to tell apt that you want to use software from anothe repository
sudo is saying i want to run this command as the admin, gedit is the program you want to run, and /etc/apt/sources.list is the path to the file
Uncomment the following two lines to fetch updated software from the network?
yes
what is uncommenting
remove the #
yea that means remove the # from infront of the lines
xskoulax: aptitude can uncomment lines for you
from all of the lines in that text file?
no
no
not all
just those two
the 2 first ones?
no
the two following that statement.
## leave alone # remove
Uncomment the following two lines to add software from the 'universe'
those i do not touch?
yes
bah.
ERGH
look :
yes
#deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty main restricted universe
the first ## is : Uncomment the following two lines to fetch updated software from the network
becomes deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ warty main restricted universe
the second ## is: Uncomment the following two lines to add software from the 'universe'
you see the two lines, right after that one that sayas "the next two lines"?
those two
the universe lines?
they have a URL in them, and at the very end they say "universe"
remove the # from the front of those lines
and i leave the the 'fetch software from the network' alone?
yes
martin_, it might help to maximize the editor
yeah, ive maximized it :)
so wordwrap isn't confusing the issue
ok ive removed the comments
ok
saved and closed
save the file
ok
now
back to the terminal
ok
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui
runt hat line
44% waiting for headers.
cool, working
yea
184kb/sec, sweet
that line is actually 2 commands
yeah i understood that && means "and"
yea
and & does nothing?
Agrajag, ?
&& means that when the first command completes successfully, run the second.
If the first command fail, do not run the second.
filas
FAILS
Uncomment the following two lines to add software from the 'universe'
bah?
& does nothing correct
man my fingers must be retarded
er i need to rewrite the error it gave me
xskoulax: yes it does
hold on this might take some time.
& by itself runs a command in the background, rather than the foreground
ok koo thats what i thought
some packages could not be isntalled. this may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are usding the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of incoming.
that's... odd.
back in a moment.
theres another thing, sec
martin_, i'm guessin he's checking something
since you only requested a single operation it is extremely likely that the package is simply not installable and a bug report against taht package should be filed. the following information may helpo to solve the situtation:
xskoulax, alright. btw, how do you type my name? you actually type it, or is there a hotkey or something
i type mar then hit the tab key and it finishes it for me :D
you could use xs tab for me
i would imagine
the following packages have unmet dependencies: bittornado-gui:depends:libwxgtk2.4-python but it is not going to be installed
oh cool
i didnt know you could do that here
that means bittornado needs a python libary
which would be a dll in windows
at least thats my understanding
i dont even know what ddl files are for
is there a hotkey to maximize/minimized windows?
dlls are like small chunks of program that can be use by lots of programs
but if you are missing the dll your program is like wait a second i have a peice missing
and crashes :D
alt+f5 alt+f9 its seems
oh ok :)
figure it out yet martin_ ?
i'm guessing you're using xchat for irc, if you click on the X icon it will show the short cuts on the menu
Agrajag, nope
<martin_> the following packages have unmet dependencies: bittornado-gui:depends:libwxgtk2.4-python but it is not going to be installed
xskoulax, yes i am
hm :-(
xskoulax, which x icon, top left?
yea
sorry i meant the program icon not close :p
xskoulax, i didnt close :)
i know, but that was poor guiding on my part :)
My problem is that I dont have a /dev/hdc and /dev/hdd entry. In /dev I have entries for my disks, for my audio devices, for my input devices and also for my floppy device but no entry for my cdroms. How i can fix it?
how come alt+f8 doesnt do anything?
it should resize
dunno
i,ve never used those short cuts before
you have to click near the edge i think with that
oh, its done with the arrows
hi
with the keyboard arrows
oh yea
yea just tried it
hello alexissoft
see martin_ you just taught me something
:-(
yes xskoulax ^^
zdrasti zenkov
google > #ubuntu > *
xskoulax: hi
thats as far as my russian extends but least i could do was say hi
i know a few russian words. kak dila?
:-)
i know that one t00
:)
zhopa
:D
where did Agrajag go?
ammm
nore sure
not*
xskoulax, maybe you could help me?
i know what the problem is but i don't know how to fix it :/
I'm here
yo Agrajag
what is the problem?
Agrajag did you see this <martin_> the following packages have unmet dependencies: bittornado-gui:depends:libwxgtk2.4-python but it is not going to be installed
hm
zenkov, i think you would have to add the stuff for your cdroms manually
what about: sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.4-python
nm i misread that
then: sudo apt-get install bittornado-gui
working on it..
its not seeing the actual devices, are they burners zenkov
Agrajag, i ran it through f2 but it didnt do anything
oh i didnt click run in terminal :)
uh
just keep a terminal open dude
oh ok
makes things a lot easier
well it finished both things
ok
what happens when you run btdownloadgui from a terminal
lets find out
command could not be found
btdownloadgui or btdownload-gui
?
same
it's btdownloadgui
so wait, you said "it finished both things"
what do you mean?
well i ran those 2 commands from f2
ok
so all i saw is "done" and it closed
run it in a temrinal
ok sec
open a terminal, keep it open
ok
the alt-f2 run thingy is best used for starting GUI programs
applications > system tools > terminal if you forgot where it is
Agrajag, after running sudo apt-get install libwxgtk2.4-python it gave me the same error
as the first time
xskoulax, didnt forget, thx though
ok, something is seriously messed up
yea i think so, i just grabbed it from universe fine
-_-
mmmm
xskoulax: but why don't work udev/rules.d/udev.rules and udev/cdsymlinks.sh?
zenkov, are you talking to me in russian :P, I'm pretty much a n00b
xskoulax, he's asking you why those files or whatever dont work
i just know that burners are treated like scsi devices oftern
martin_, i realised what he was asking, its over my head though :D
:)
bah.. so synaptic doesnt work at all on my comp?
martin_, it prolly works
xskoulax, how do i change password?
user password, that is
try another package maybe?
martin_: passwd
run that in a terminal
alright
hey all
ok cool
hi Auzy
well, I hope you figure out your apt problem, but as it's about 3 am I'm going to sleep
Agrajag, what other package?
dunno
um
I'm just curious if anyones been working on trying to get enlightenment 17 working in ubantu?
Agrajag, alright, thanks for the help and good night :)
Agrajag, u in west coast us/
?
yes
ok denver here
:D
gn Agrajag, i'll see if i can help him out
night all

xskoulax, how do i add a timer to the chat?
next to each one's nickname
to know what time the message was sent
hmm.. i guess thats a no?? cause I really need the e17 libs for the thing I'm making :(
martin_, settings > prefs
there is an option to time stamp text
well xskoulax do you have any idea about what my problem might be?
hi
hi
hi decklin
hi demon666_nl
hi tuxJr_14 :)
Will there be a network install for ubuntu ? (I know I can do this with debian and after that upgrade to ubuntu but a friend of mine wants an easy way to install ubuntu and he hasn't got a cd-rom drive)
hi decklin
hi tuxJr_14 :)
hi demon666_nl
Will there be a network install for ubuntu ?
demon666_nl: I already installed warty via network
demon666_nl: You can run it in ,,custom'' mode, install base and apt-get rest
siretart: he means a tiny CD image.
I thought there was a tiny CD image.
ok im trying to figger out the debian-installer hd numbering
i want to install to hda3
hda1 exists , hda2 is a extended, does that mean #2 in the installer is tho correct?
the*
I'm trying to figure that out too..
remi
jordi: I dont find it right now, but I used to have a tiny cd netinst image (about 4mb iso image) for warty
I meant installing without a CD
I mean a floppy image
how exactly do you set up a dsl connection once ubuntu is installed?
hi. anyone knows if ubuntu cvs binary has http proxy support? how can I enable it?
can anyone paste the sources.list line for the current ubuntu unstable branch?
Zomb, just s/warty/horay
hi
pisuke: s,debian,ubuntu, -> no "just", dude
the doc search system on the homepage sucks. Does not find "sources.list".
Will there be a floppy netinstall image for ubuntu ?
Can someone tell me how to mount another ext3 partition so that any user can read/write to it?
Hi my 1st time on irc
hello davybondo
welcome to the harsh and addictive world of irc
davybondo: welcome to the productivity blackhole.
HAHAHAHAa
heh
Hi housetier and all you guys
can I ask 1 of you a question about Ubuntu
this is my 1st time useing Ubuntu ....I was useing Mandrake
I wonder if the ubuntu team is considering a default firewall setup?
frogbert: ext3 is not stupid fat. It knows permission flags, so do not try to cheat the kernel.
davybondo ask your question here and it will most likely be answered
frogbert: easy ;) mount /dev/hda8 /mnt ; chmod -R a+rwx /mnt/*
but that's probably not what you wanted..
I'm trying to access my hdc drive but it's disabled anybody know how I can access it......Thanks
disabled?
I have XP on the hdc drive and Ubuntu on my slave drive hdd
frogbert, can't you just set low permissions on it?
davybondo, have you selected the correct partition?
hdc1 or whatever
ya tried both ...they have a red icon on them
what is ubuntu all abt. its spreadin like fire
www.ubuntulinux.org, it's the coolest linux distribution in town!
ar|k, ubuntu means humanity towards others ;)
is it better than mepis/.
says I dont have permission it wont let me log on as root
davybondo, what does mount -t ntfs /dev/hdc1 /mnt/windows say?
mepis is a livecd
ubuntu is an operating system
simple installation?
Okay so will that say that way when I reboot?
davybondo, are you aware of the way root is handled in ubuntu?
I'll try that Pozac ...should I type into a terminal window
bob2: you know what I need? a livecd with dev tools and distcc.. *grin*
cef: haha
bob2: for all those work machines that sit idle every night
davybondo, yeah.. if you need to be root, use 'sudo -s' first
cef, like the gentoo one? :)
im new to linux. im thinking of installing mandrake10.1 cos they say this is the easiest. pls tell me what ubuntu can offer... plss
Pozac: yeah, but all ubuntu.. none of that silly gentoo over-optimization
ar|k: if you don't know anything about linux, then about the only thing that matters is ease of installation.  I'm pretty sure ubuntu's is simpler than mandrake's.
cef ;)
ubuntu install is so easy
what abt other installations?
try them
ar|k: you'd have to ask them
they are free
:)
e.g., #mandrake or whatever
I highly recommend Ubuntu for everyone.
me too
thanks
davybondo, did you add anything to your /etc/fstab file?
tried it Pozac typed in -t ntfs /dev/hdc1 /mnt/windows and came back with               command not found, I know it is a ntfs file system
you forgot the word 'mount'
davybondo, mount :)
no never heard of that
sudo mount  -t ntfs /dev/hdc1 /mnt/windows
if /mnt/windows is where you want it
Isn't this documented somewhere?
yes
davybondo, read here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1886&page=1&pp=10
also in the faq
and the ubuntu guide thing
and lots of howto's
Will there be a floppy netinstall image for ubuntu ?
Thanks Pozac.......I think I'll go read up on it
how can I unmount a flash drive when it is busy?
demon666_nl: it's being worked on, and is a 'good to have goal, iirc
atropus: kill whatever is making it busy
davybondo, no problem :) if you still have problems after reading, come back here :)
man mount fstab
Thanks a lot      Cya later
demon666_nl, Please make one! ;)
is there someone who speek italian?
I do not
so, i try to speek en..
bob2 do you know if it's a goal for hoary or grumpy ? do you know where to find more about this on the wiki ?
marco: #ubuntu-it
demon666_nl: hoary, iirc, maybe on the hoary goals page?
thanks bob!!!
bye to all
hello
hi
i have installed ubuntu on a low spec laptop using the howto from the main site
and have also added openoffice
but can't find out how to start open office
it is not in the applications folder
which 'application folder'?
when you click on the IceWM icon
you have Applications
you need to mention that you're using icewm then :)
sorry
I wonder if the ubuntu team is considering a default firewall setup?
is there already a tool for defining firewalls?
is there PPPOE confiuration?
(in an easy way)
bob2 : I can't find anything about it on the wiki. (only howto's if you've installed linux already or use knoppix or debian bootfloppy's)
vegai, I am using firestarter
vegai, it's nice
vegai, http://www.fs-security.com/
firestarter is nice. But not necessary if you don't install additional services. See http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=7511
AndyFit1, very nice
AndyFit1, msg me your aim name again
usual: AndyFitzGeek
ok gotcha
icons look great
thanks mate
AndyFit1, just to let you know, gnome crashed for me on login
AndyFit1, said panel was already running
AndyFit1, gnome is behaving strange
ouch, thats happened to me in hoary too
AndyFit1, have you made a firefox icon yet?
now I know why people wear those _Insert name_ broke my gnome   t-shirts
vegai: there are lots, but none of them were considered 'best of breed' enough to go in
vegai: also, the default install has no need for a firewall
hehe
demon666_nl: but aren't daemons automatically started in Debian/Ubuntu?
usual,  checkout http://andy.fitzsimon.com.au/etq
I can't use the firefox logo.  but I have made an svg for it
AndyFit1, I see, nice work either way
http://andy.fitzsimon.com.au/etq/trademarks.svg  if you want the svg :-P
will xfce4 go on this
etorix: yes
ERROR 404: Not Found.
erm .. what about KDE
demon666_nl: dunno then, I believe kamion was working on it...maybe ask on the ubuntu-devel list?
etorix: yes but  not much support for it with this distro
AndyFit1, did you move the file or something?
you'll basically  get what debian has
ok .. im on amd64 .. i have sources
usual: I'm checking what happened to it ..    brisgeek is a debian box  . never lets me down.    fitzsimon.com.au is a win2k box ( I only use it for the storage space )  its constantly flaky
haha
Ubuntu 5.04 "Hoary Hedgehog" - Alpha amd64 Binary-1 .. i just installed
usual,  it went missing ... weird ..  its up now
k
usual, the October wallpaper  2nd from the top on http://brisgeek.com/etiquette/downloads.html  works best with the icon them I find
k
they are just cinepaint to gimp mods of the dark brown calender png files. a bit more elegant I think
i have no root account .. .. no choice other than 640x480 ..
so dialogs are un-accessible
they go off-screen
uptime
AndyFit1, how can I extract the trademark icons in inkscape
just open the svg file, make a new document 128x128 pt and copy paste the ones you want and save them
Hi to all
hi wood1
Great to back to #ubuntu
I miss you guys and dolls
and welcome back
AndyFit1, I see a bunch or templates but nowhere to custom tell it to do 128x128
usual CTRL+SHIFT+D
just open the document properties dialog
vegai : all ports are closed by default and only opened when you install something like apache. But firestarter might be nice if you want to make sure those services aren't reachable. A firewall is also nice if you're paranoid :)
totem-xine and mplayer arent opening my divx :P
bob2 : thnx
How do I transfer a file from Amsn to somebody from Gaim ?
AndyFit1, do I have to do something special to perfectly paste the icon into the new doc? or do I just drag it over it and hope for the best
I wanna watch theOCS02E06.  too bad I guess lol
AndyFit1, did you install the multimedia packages like libdvdcss2 or whatever
usual, those bugs were fixed when I visited the inkscape dev team in melbourne :)
it should work fine.  but ungrouping everything and pressing up down helps too.. also making sure you vacuum the defs every so often
how does one verify the iso is not corrupted? ie md5?
or does ubuntu not have this?
usual: yeah I installed everything needed.  and I didnt uninstall anything .  the same files that played a few days ago won't play now  with no corruption etc
usual,  could you pm me you sources.list  ?
AndyFit1, sure
you= your
thanks .  I did alot of sources.list cleansing when gnome-panel didnt load ;)
hmm .. why didnt i get an option to set a root password and account
how am i i sposed to edit
AndyFit1, 1 sec
etorix, because it uses sudo
now you type sudo -s  instead of su
the user is in the sudoers?
if you want more than the first user to be able to use sudo  you have to edit sudoers
ah ok
no second user
hello ubunte[i] rs :D
it seems to work ok so far but i need to do a bit of serious editing from within
hi all
may i aska fedora installation question here, if people dont mind?
no i mind
oh! why? its REALLY serious and someone here might know!?
dont ask to ask, just ask... (i guess noboby will know the ansyer ;) )
-> #fedora
i inserted FC3 first disc , the install was about to start and it gave an error about disk space and i neede to restarts. henceforth, ever since install start, the x server starts, display a rainbow stripes horizontal lines and hangs the amchine
answer even
good question, next one ;)
fabbione: i need all possible help
AcidPils: LOL. i am serious! :P
sorry, i never used fedora
-> #fedora
ok
da_bon_bon: me on my new asus notebook, the fc3 dont works.
i used fedora for a day or so
gsuveg: it worked the first time
da_bon_bon: test with ubuntu :)
cant you change to a console? maybe with some more input would help
gsuveg: i have alreadytried ubuntu and like it
why fedora then? oO
yes. why ?
AcidPils: to get the feel of it. also, i LOVE kde
kde is great... as long as i dont have to use it
da_bon_bon: then apt-get install kde or so
zenlunatic: in the installer, go back to the main menu and look for "verify the CD-ROM's integrity" near the bottom
gsuveg: ok. but i still wanana try FC3
da_bon_bon: intall vmware ;)
fc3 = no apt
gsuveg: i was thinking of that!!
etorix: nono. you can use apt in fc
Hi! I'm quite new to linux (haven't gotten it to work well enough for me yet), and I'll probably be installing Ubuntu next time I'll try it out. I'm wondering if this channel is friendly towards help requests concerning ubuntu, and linux in general - can I get help here during the setup process?
Ileden: yep
Great. :)
as long as you have read the docs first, people here will be happy to help
im also new to this chan, but most of the guys here are helful
Well, I'll be sure to try the docs first, but not everything is that well documented, at least for those with not much previous technical experience with linux...
I haven't yet read the ubuntu docs, though.
Could anyone tell me how to change my default media player from Totem to something else?
ah, hi AcidPils ;)
I'd also like to know whether this channel has a friendly attitude towards helping out on setting up technically insignificant, but usability-wise meaningful features for ubuntu? Often some of my questions and laments about some aspects of linux have been met with somewhat of a resistance from people using linux, which does make setting up a linux for my tastes a problem.
Ileden: I have a good impression of the ubuntu community. Both in this channel and in the wiki
Ileden: but you'll never learn if you don't try ;)
siretart: From what small I've seen at the wiki, I also got a good impression. One of the reasons ubuntu seems so appealing. :)
siretart: So true. The main problem is just that - you (or at least I) mostly learn by doing. But I need to have the system up and working for me to start learning how it works. And from previous experience it seems to set up linux (not just install) you need to know how it works. So there we have an endless loop. :)
by setting up I don't just mean the installation.
I mean installing and setting up all the software required for normal use of a computer system -.which is somewhat extensive list for me :)
Ileden: ubuntu works fairly good at setting up a gnome desktop with office tools like openoffice and evolution. it depends how YOU want to use your computer. for many people this suffices
best way to learn is by doing
hrm i just want to get rid of totem... stupid totem
hi siretart i found my way to this channel at last ;)
hehe
siretart: yes, that is the problem, for most people Office is enough. I however have some more uses, and on previous occasion I haven't gotten all of the applications I want to work.
and most people that have more uses already know how to use linux. :)
Ileden: what applications are you talking of?
well, last time I tried (Mandrake) I couldn't get grip to copy CDs properly, nor could I understand how the cd writing software was meant to be used. To name two examples.
grip is not a burning application, but a fairly good ripper
oh, sorry, I wasn't using grip for trying to burn something.
I don't remember what I used anymore, it was more than a year ago, or something. :)
there were other problems as well, but I'm afraid I don't recall all of them either. :)
I have tried to map out my uses for my computer though, to approach moving to linux at least in a somewhat organized fashion.
But anyway, I'll probably won't have time for my next attempt at linux until next year, so this I'm just here to check out whether the Ubuntu community is nice and friendly enough to help me. :)
!search download accelerator
hello thar
Amaranth, how are you?
are you there
g'day,  anybody know if there is a specific file used for folding@home ?  and if so do they have a mimetype ?
Treenaks, are you there ?
AndyFit, do you know how to install fonts in Ubuntu ?
I want to install some ttf fonts
wood1: yeah there are a few ways..    the easiest is to go to fonts:// in nautilus and drag and drop them
open nautilus  go  CTRL+L  type fonts://  and drag the ttf files in there
fonts://
that's it
anyone know of a good repository that has things like f-spot, muine, tomboy?
i need at least those appas
thanks Andy
nps
has anyone in here tried to play Postal for linux?
hrm actually, more accurately, has anyone tried to play a game and have it completely mess up the xserver?
srbaker: f-spot is very unstable unless you get it from cvs
hi, whats the difference between debian and ubuntu?
royalbuds: ubuntu is more user friendly
oh
suck
what about tomboy packages?
like if i try to play netpanzer or postal, my xserver goes nuts and dies on me, have to restart it
|rufius|, but what about the packages, can i use debian mirrors?
the rest should be in unstable or multiverse
I mean universe
uh, tomboy isn't
royalbuds: if you wanted to but i havent found much that the ubuntu mirrors didn'th ave...
srbaker ? hoary ?
|rufius|, but i can use apt?
AndyFit1, no, warty
royalbuds, yep apt is the package manager for ubuntu too
ahh sorry  yeah I know there is a repo for warty too.    getswea something something
srbaker, tseng's repo has those things
royalbuds: its debian essentially, if it didn't have apt, you couldn't call it based on debian
;)
thx
AndyFit, how do I know which services are running on my system right now ?
srbaker, hang on i give you apt line
http://www.getsweaaa.com/~tseng/ubuntu/
:)
http://www.getsweaaa.com/~tseng/ubuntu/debs/ ./
wood1:  in gnome-system tools there is a runlevel editor .  but for somereason it isnt included in ubuntu
I wish it were
How do I use that ?
Is it installed or do we have to manually install it ?
srbaker, im on hoary, fspot is a no go here still, you can install it, but it wont start
wow
tseng has all of those
nice
wood1  its not installed and I'm not sure why it isnt in the repos anymore
linux_mafia, ahh, then i'll wait for it to not suck
it was in there once
What is tomboy ???
but I updated and it disappeared
srbaker, you could try cvs, but i havent bothered
wood1, mono app for taking notes
oh damn.  mono is only in universe
wood1, tomboy is a wiki for your desktop.  it kicks major ass
What does it do actually ?
wood1, http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/
wood1, google for "Seven Cool Mono Apps" and read about it
good morning from someone that has 10 days off :)
off what?
work
oh
is it possible to install ubuntu over the network from the i386 install cd?
apparently the CD-ROM drive is not detected on Dell PowerEdge 750 servers
http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-4062.html implies it is possible, but I cannot find network installation methods anywhere
mgedmin, http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/NetbootInstallHowto/view?searchterm=net%20install
morning macewan
:)
I'll be right back
we have a fully transparent gnome-panel in hoary! yippie
because of xorg
?
not counting the vwm that ant transparent
Does ubuntu use xorg or xfree86?
werty uses xfree
hoary uses xorg
hrm ok
macewan: no, gnome-panel and gnome-applets 2.9.3
then i don't understand whats going on w/ netpanzer...
actually i'm running xf86 under hoary
i have xorg
and i love it
it's nice but i found it fairly slow
i found its slow when i run xcompmgr
so xcompmgr is for screenshots only
Andy, how do I install tomboy ?
hi :)
hi DoktorTomoe :)
What is the proper way of installing JAVA under Ubuntu Hoary?
untar, make, sudo make install I believe
for wood1
www.ubuntuguid.org go thare for java install DoktorTomoe
tim1, are all the applets transparent too?
ubuntuguide.org
Pozac, yes
How do I open the Nautilus browser as the root user ?
Andy
sweet
macewan
wood1, sudo nautlius
tomboy install
Pozac: the ones i use are, gnome-menu, volume, clock ...
tim1,  and weather
tim1, no pager?
lol
Am I the only one using the bubblemon applet? It's totally sweet, though slightly broken :(
kergan: weather yes
ah yeah dot slash configure before you make wood1
Pozac: what does pager do? everything is german over here
tim1,  i was makingshure you dint forget any applets
tim1, It shows mini previews of the workspaces
It doesn't seem to fixed yet :(
its the vwm
hm how can the pager be transparent ?
dunno :)
it can be better than now
Pozac, what is the "bubblemon"applet do?
it looks really out of place
Gwildor, cpu load, mem, swap monitor
Pozac, ahhh, imma have to look into that
Gwildor, it has some problems with memory though... it doesn't leave out the buffers/cache part, so memory seems to be full very quick :(
Java: tried the way of ubuntuguide, didnt work
hi
hi BlacKnight|
blackwell
DoktorTomoe, then you dint follow the instructions
Andy, I can't paste some TTF fonts in Nautilus ?
:)
casue its installed and works just fine
kergan: to the very letters.
hmmm
what ver of java
1.5
java? install problems?
Blackwell, i know
lol
welp i am off to work
bye alll
1.4.2
1.5 does not work for me -_-
DoktorTomoe: try better than "does not work"?
Blackwell: The custom banking account application written by that damn freelancer I have to use is not running under 1.5
DoktorTomoe: ah, so java 1.5 is running fine on your box? who's next? :)
Java 1.5 used to run on that old SuSE-Box of mine. I tried it there. Ubuntu is pretty new on this system
Blackwell: The Problem is how to install Java 1.4.2 on Ubuntu, because I am stuck with this java application (it refuses to run under 1.5)
DoktorTomoe: same way as 1.5 :)
DoktorTomoe: http://javafaq.mine.nu/lookup?67
Are there any goodies in the linux-image-2.6.9-1 build that are not in 2.6.8.1 ?
Pozac, inotify
ohh
for gamin?
is there a ppp-setup app?
Pozac, i guess, i only know of its use with beagle
pppconfig gives me just errors
/usr/sbin/pppconfig: line 24: BEGIN: command not found
ha ha ha
/usr/sbin/pppconfig: line 25: use: command not found
etorix, did you try System Settings -> Network ?
ok ill try that
.. i cant find any ppp stuff in the *install* manual
linux_mafia, I'm hoping inotify/gamin will solve alot of my FAM woes :)
Pozac, i dont think gamin really has anything to do with inotify, at the moment anyway, until dnotify is completely depreciated
linux_mafia, ok :(
hm. good to see that it is not only java developers who get "deprecated" wrong all the time. ;)
Blackwell, its deprecation or what win32 has become :)
Blackwell, hey your right, i guess i never thought about it, must be mis-spelled/mis-used so often
Pozac: win32, deprecated? funk, nobody told me. i need to tell my boss, we need to cancel the current project. :)
Blackwell, Its not. It should. :)
linux_mafia: i keep seeing it in the java realm. it's too funny, even the sharpest and most nitpicking java folks get it wrong now and then. ;)
Pozac: ah, perhaps, like any c level api :)
What is the difference between a .tar file and a .bz2 file format ?
but then again, someone's got to write the nice infrastructure for us high level bozos...:)
wood1, tar just packs file into one, no compression
hello thar
wood1: one os file archive with compression, the other only an archive.
http://www.macewan.org/index.php?m=200412#post-200
wood1, bz2 and gz are ways to compress that single tar file
could someone look at that and tell me if it makes sense?
it's a tomboy howto install
wood1: actually, i take that bz2 being a file archive format back. it may be, don't know. :)
macewan, compiling is not needed on ubuntu
macewan: install of vs. on?
macewan: there are tomboy .deb packages
really?
in hoary ...
what about warty
I got the package from somewhere when I ran warty
tim1, you got mono working in hoary?
macewan: consider bold step marks or something, so that at first glance the steps can be told apart easily. oh, i know, i am nitpicking on form, not content. :-)
http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/t/tomboy/
hey guys, i'm not new to linux but I have never needed to try and dialup before, can someone point me to a good howto or to where the config is so I can try and figure it out?
no, thanks for the input
:)
Pozac: there are also .deb packages for mono :)
neep neep
tim1, I can't install it since it was removed a few days ago
deb http://www.getsweaaa.com/~tseng/ubuntu/debs ./ <- to get tomboy, from http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions
in warty
Kirsch: got dsl?
yeah i can't update it to 1.0.4 either, but 1.0.2 is still working
well I'll be
So how do I go about installing 1.0.2 ?
shit, last cig
linux_mafia: smoking can cause death.
is it worth upgrading to hoary hedgehog ?
apt-get install mono=1.0.2
and cancer. and...
in hoary it complains about not have *mint or something another not being version 1.0.4
is hoaring hedgehog worth the upgrade ?
Blackwell: No, Dialup
old fashioned 56K
PPP
tim1, version 1.0.2 not found..
hm
rhodan, it breaks but it's sweet. You decide. :)
hoaring hedgehog, haha, (pictures a hedgehog out on a boozy stripclub night)
kekeke
pozac: wait a second
can the "tar" command be used to unzip .zip files
Pozac: what breaks ? anything major ?
use unzip
I can't extract a .bz2 file using tar ?
rhodan, ubuntu is released every 6 months, with feature additions in the beginning (=breakage, like X.Org was a few days ago), but later on it will stabilize
bunzip2 *.bz2
wood1, tar vxjpf archive.tar.bz2
wood1, it all depends, a straight .bz2 you would use bzip2 -d <file> a tar.bz2 then tar jxf <filr>
linux_mafia: Ehm. j means to do automatic bzip2 decompression. either bzip2 -d first or j as a flag to tar.
wood1, if you have got X, then file-roller is a sweet tool. :)
pozac: i have the 1.0.2 packages still in my apt cache
By the way, I can't connect to this IRC Channel using Port 6667
How do I know where my modem is?
maswan, yeah i know, didnt make myself clear, a straight .bz2 you would use bzip2 -d <file> or if you have a tar.bz2 then tar jxf <file>, better?
which /dev/ttySX ?
tim1, I'll just wait for some fixage :)
Could that be due to some firewall that I can't connect to this #IRC using gaim
tim1, thanks :)
maswan, or can you go tar j on a straight .bz2, is that what youre saying?
pozac: ok :)
linux_mafia, I think that my network administrator has block the port 6667
How do I connect to gaim and still access port 6667
tar xvfz *.tar.gz or *.tgz
tar xvfj *.tar.bz2
wood1: ask your network admin. you don't want to get fired for hacking your way around a block set up esp. for you.
that's it. or use fireroller :)
using gaim for irc? odd, or is it common? ive used xchat or bitchx only
Well Blackwell, is there a way out ?
packer/unpacker support isn't integrated into the file explorer?
linux_mafia: the first thing
wood1: a six-pack might do the trick.
Linux_mafia, which software are you using to chat in this forum right now ?
xchat
I am using gaim
wood1: excellent, so your port 6667 is not blocked?
How many of you here use Gaim to access this chat forum ?
wood1: this is irc. not a forum.
hi ya, I can't figure out how to setup my home network. I would like ubuntu act as my internet gateway for another 2 boxes. I have eth0 internet (sis), eth1(sis) and eth2(via). witch ip I need to set on eth1?
in a way, it's also a forum
there were fora (?) before there phpBB and the internets
Aoi: consider a little broadband router. that is more secure since there is less room for screwing up the security related config. you can still have the ubuntu box behind that nat router.
Blackwell, this is the only PC on my network which does not have the port 6667 blocked because it is used as a fax Server
wood1: yeah, i hear fax uses port 6667.
Pozax, I understand that this is not a forum
(kidding)
Blacwell what do you think use a nat router and setup firestarter?
Aoi, Use a class C adress, like 192.168.1.1
So is there a way out to access this chatroom from my other Network PCs?
i'm trying to install mplayer following the FAQ off the ubuntu forum
Aoi: i don't know what firestarter is. but i mean do not use a pc for the first line of defense. it is too easy to screw the security related configuration up.
I have installed Ubuntu on all of my network pcs
Pozac, how can I do it? eth1 192.0.0.1 and my windowz box 192.0.0.2 ? (crossed over)
but when i run  $ sudo apt-get install libpng-dev
Blackwell, I see, firestarter is a iptables gui
it says i need to specifically choose one to install
any ideas
Aoi, you need the 192.168 part, but otherwise ok
I don't mind use ubuntu as the first line defense because it is dedicated
So Blackwell, is there a way to connect to this chatroom from my other PCs ?
Aoi: these routers cost something like usd30, 40. really worth their money.
Aoi, read a gateway or nat howto
i know this may be a long shot, but i have an LG4500 (Verizon, USA) phone with a datacable, I know that in windows i was able to use it as a modem and dialup. Is there a way i can do this in Linux?
Aoi: more points to get it wrong than right, with a full blown operating system, in my opinion. but that's just me perhaps.
Pozac, I can't figure out, ipconfig eth1 192.0.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0 ? then I need to forward ipv4 ?
I own a Linksys router. It's a 166mhz box that runs Linux :)
Blackwell, how do you mean by a six-pack ????
daisy chaining them works nicely :)
linux_mafia, I've try to find at google but I couldn't find a "easy" one
Aoi, echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward i believe
Blackwell, I see.
wood1: a friendly smile, a six-pack of beer on the admin's desk, that may be all you need to get over that port block. :)
Pozac, oh just only it? wow nat rlz lol
Oh no
wait, if I tur on eth1, my eth0 internet goes down
I can't find a clear nat howto
the interface is down? or just can't connect?
guys, in the terminal, when i want to use a command i have to first type gnome-terminal (and then) --help, for example. is there a way to make gnome-terminal a passive command or something?
if eth1 up, eth0 can't connect
Aoi, are they the same type of card?
Aoi, Are you sure you want nat and not just ip masq?
hey guys and dolls, isn't there no way to connect to this chatroom from PCs whose port 6667 are blocked ?
linux_mafia, yes
linux_mafia, I have 2 sis and 1 via
Aoi, bring eth1 up first
Aoi, then you need aliases for the modules iirc
1 sis eth0, another sis eth1 (the via one I don't mind)
modules iirc linux_mafia ? I don't understand O-o
Pozac, eth1 up but not active let me test
guys, in the terminal, when i want to use a command i have to first type gnome-terminal (and then) --help, for example. is there a way to make gnome-terminal a passive command or something?....
martin_, We don't understand your question
martin_, How would you run a simple command like 'mount' instead of gnome-terminal (from the terminal?)
you mean something like: man tomboy
Pozac, you mean thats just the way it is in the terminal?
help instructions
Pozac, do you know a way to connect to this chatroom ?
Pozac, how about when i go to tty?
pozac, if I turn on eth1, eth0 can't connect
macewan
martin_, (and please don't just repeat it, it's not a nice thing to do like in real life)
Pozac, in real life if someone doesnt hear you, its the most logical thing to do...
wood1, Dont known.. have your admin open up the port
martin_, But we heard you
Pozac, ok sorry nevermind. i wont do that again
martin_, what exactly do you need to do?
clicking the terminal shortcut is the same action as running gnome-terminal
Aoi, hmm
Pozac, im just trying to learn linux.. my first time
Aoi, sorry was on phone, you there?
and typing gnome-terminal before each command can get really annoying
Pozac: You said earlier that compiling isn't needed on Ubuntu.
martin_, it's ok, hang in there :)
isnt there a way to bypass it?
martin_, you should _never_ need to type gnome-terminal
linux_mafia, yes
but Pozac, if for example i type --help in the terminal window, it says unkown command
Pozac: why is it not needed?
only if i type gnome-terminal --help it works
linux_mafia, I'm trying to figure out how to "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"
martin_, --help is not a command :) mount is a command
oh.
Aoi, ok, i havent done this for ever, but basically, you cant have the same module used for 2 pieces of hardware
I'm running hoary right now, and there seems to be a dependancy issue with things needing python 2.3, and 2.4 being standard in ubuntu.  I know hoary is development and I shouldn't be whining, but is there a way to fix that?
Pozac, where can i get a list of commands then?
linux_mafia, I'm used to "su -"
martin_, type ls /usr/bin
linux_mafia, oh I see, what I'm supposed to do in my case?
linux_mafia, eth are loading ok, but I can't figure out how to setup it
it says no such directory, Pozac
martin_, In linux (unix) all executable files are in /bin and /usr/bin
note the slash / .. not \ like windows
Pozac: that's not right; what about /usr/X11R6/bin
?
pw, true.. and the rest of $PATH
Pozac: I guess because the packages can be retrieved via apt-get? :)
well it says theres no such directory Pozac
although ls works
martin_, why are you typing commands? what do you want to do?
grelli: you should not be whining :)
Otherwise, you really should be clicking around in ubuntu's gorgeus Gnome :)
grelli: for the most part, the transition to python2.4 is going smoothly
ala
x-mas is close
jingle bells
merry x-mas all ubuntu-users and developers
not everyone celebrates christmas
i wonder how long it will take for that x-mas thing to turn sour this year. :)
crimsun there just seems to be a few packages that still depend on 2.3
macewan, sorry, the packages can.. from the wiki FAQ
I'm not christian but I still celebrate x-mas for the sake of all ppl
i predict one more day until people start with their yearly "yeah, yeah, f*cking happy x-crap, move on ffs..." ;)
e crimsun
macewan, http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/FrequentlyAskedQuestions
Pozac, i want to learn how to use linux through commands, not through graphics...
i can do that through windows
martin_, then you need to read
hehe
Pozac, thats why i asked where can i read
martin_: It might be an idea for you to get a good Linux boox.
er.
Book.
yah
Try "Running Linux".
martin_: it helps to have some gui to get something going and working at all. believe me...you cannot avoid "OS sex" with linux. ;)
martin_: hell, not even os x manages to keep the unix backend away from you.
linux.org may have links to such things martin_
linuxdoc.org perhaps
martin_: If you really, really, really want to "learn linux" then you should install Linux From Scratch.
Chibifs?
None of that wussy hand-holding "distribution" nonsense.
o'reilly is always good
martin_: if available to you, consider installing linux in a vmware environment. allows for quickly testing various distros, etc. without any risk of destroying your existing pc configuration.
re etorix
e
grelli: patience, patience :)
im on a ubuntu x64
crimsun I know, I've used debian for years
Ok bye to all
bye wood1
bye
apt doesnt like my xfce4 sources
good luck, wood1
Cheers to Ubuntu and this Chat room
Looking for assistance installing a Sonicwall Long Range Wireless Card.
Getting closer.. the term is channel :)
what happens if i uninstall ubuntu-desktop?
I know how things get
micsch, nothing
realy
micsch, ubuntu-desktop just depends on what the ubuntu desktop should contain
so if you only remove that, it shouldnt change anything
etorix: how is it complaining?
unless the devs change how they want the desktop to be
Can anyone assist with installing a Sonicwall Long Range Wireless card?
i tell a lie .. it sees it
I had to uninstall ubuntu-desktop to install totem-xine
unless xfce4x64 is in ubuntu
Soniwall Wirelss (802.11b) install help needed...
http://www.linux-wlan.org/docs/wlan_adapters.html.gz
ok .. it was giving a ign at the beginning .. but its ok now
http://www.seattlewireless.net/index.cgi/SenaoCard
that may point you in the right direction viz: what the card really is
the linux-wlan makes no mention of a Sonicwall Card.
on the face of it, it looks like it's a prism2 based card.
I know that it has a Prism2 chip.
I must drop.... will return.
anyone upgraded to the latest alsa for sound blaster card use with 2.6.8?
o0o-er .. wot .. no gkrellm
hi to all. why i cannot login as root? everytime i have to login as user and type "su" and password...
garcia79, sudo
its not a bug .. its a feature ..  apparently
i use sudo to do some operations on the system, but i use su to change to root...
sudo -s
theres a howto in the manual
sudo -s? oh thanks usual and etorix
garcia79, sudo -s will drop you into a root shell
Pozac^AFK, thanks dude, I had sucessfully set up
i understand...thanks!
i have another stupid ;-) question.
how can i connect to the internet. I'm not kidding! i used pppoeconf to configure my connection ADSL, but now i' dont know how to connect...
dunno
i use cable
excuse for my english
my dsl just......worked
garcia79, are you using a router?
tried pon
garcia79, does network-admin work?
i think that my adsl modem is not a router...
i try to explain me better....
now i'm on line using ubuntu with my dsl modem
garcia79, my adsl modem run DHCP, so I just use dhcpcd on my WAN interface :)
Pozac, i used synaptic to get codecs are whatever for music player to play mp3
i updated and installed whats it called hmmm...
but i don't know how to connect... what command from terminal? i know it is a stupid question. i'm connceted but i don't now how i did
martin_, I use xmms for mp3
well gst something
anyhow..
martin_: gstreamer0.8-mad?
garcia79, ifup eth0 perhaps?
crimsun, thats the one
:)
no....
gstreamer-mad enables rhythmbox and beep-media-player to play mp3s
garcia79: pon ...?
now when i try to run music player, it gives me this error: failed to create the player: couldnt initialise scheduler gst-register?
crimsun*
pon, yes... i build on the desktop a launcher for pon. but i was not sure...wait a moment please...
garcia79, use the modem applet :)
pozac, any idea why it would give me that error?
martin_, try running gst-register-0.8 in the terminal
heh thanks
:)
np ;)
pozac, if i want to get bittorrent or bittornado for linux, how can i do that?
martin_, it's in apt :)
synaptic?
yep
just Search for bittorrent, select it, then Apply
gui stands for graphic user interface?
yep
or sudo apt-get install bittorrent in terminal :)
whats this sudo thing?
i mean where does it come from?
or what does it represent
it comes from OpenBSD
SUperuser DO
it allows you to run a command as a different user, by default the root user
oh cool
why do i want to run a command as a different user?
you need to be in /etc/sudoers
martin_, superuser
what are these etc/ libraries
it's akin to the su(1) command but provides a command audit trail
i dont understand how these things work
martin_, in /etc lies configuration files
martin_, for easy backing up
ok . . .
martin_: Ubuntu does not configure the 'root' user's account by default in an attempt to foster more secure administration methods
man isnt there a walkthrough for linux with all the commands and what you hsould start with?
whats this root thing
hey I figured out the resolution problem I was having yesterday
?
not really...
I edited xorg.conf for the monitor refresh rate settings..
linux is generally not a toy, you need a purpose :)
martin_: http://www.physics.ubc.ca/mbelab/computer/linux-intro/html/ might help you
martin_: therefore you'd preface a command with sudo to run the command as root, since many system administration tasks require root privileges
but I guess XFree86.conf takes precedence
and it needed the settings too
Eating time. Later. :)
so if anyone cares that's how I fixed
riffic: document
cool .
that's the shame of irc, nothing of it goes into the archives, such as google and co. ;|
martin_: There's a lot of documentation out there on the web.  Googling is helpful.
Blackwell: That's why the most successful channels have wikis tied to them. :)
Blackwell: bots can log if necessary, though we encourage wiki and mailing list use first and foremost
paulproteus: hm, feeding the logs into those wikis?
Blackwell: No, having users document what they discover on wikis.
who is actually sitting down and doing that kind of work? a few power helpers do, that's it in my experience. :|
Blackwell: Yeah, guess that's true.
Blackwell: thus it is _everyone's_ job to encourage wiki and mailing list use
Blackwell: #joiito has a bot that lets any user blog.
anyone here know anyting about gnomemeeting?
Like:
paulproteus: and they actually do that? i can tell that the majority of the java newbie bozos don't give a funk. of course...they are only interested in getting their homework done and over with. ;)
?blog I got (thing) to work by reading (URL)
Blackwell: Well, #joiito is a social channel, not a tech channel.
paulproteus: hm. "pubic hair is explained at ..."? ;) just kidding.
yay if it works. i have seen to many leeches on irc.
paulproteus, thanks.
xskoulax|zzzz, music workin well :)
paulproteus, i used synapt to get bittorent and installed it... how do i know where it is installed and how do i run it>
has anyone used an infra-red device with warty ?
martin_: If you click on a dot-torrent file in Firefox it will open with BitTorrent.
hi!
man gstreamer sucks
what is a good program for scanning"?
i got ubuntu installed
paulproteus, ok thanks... but how do i know where its installed?
In Synaptic, you can find the file list for a package.
martin_: the Python scripts are installed into /usr/bin, as most executables and scripts are
and, well, when i installed mldonkey... it got the 2.5-21 version, which is totally broken
Files in directories with "bin" in them are program parts.
i installed via synaptic, i mean
...
crimsun, how do i get into those libraries?
btdownloadgui is the most straightforward to understand.
martin_: You run it on a terminal, like:
amathis, scanning what?
btdownloadgui /path/to/file.torrent
linux_mafia: with a scanner o.,o
i think the mldonkey version of ubuntu should be upgraded to a new one
amathis, ok, was thinking nmap, use xsane
;)
2.5-28h for example
btdownloadgui? whats that?
an alternative to btdownloadcurses
that doesnt tell me much :)
martin_: it has a graphical interface as opposed to a command line curses-based one.
martin_: a window, icons, etc.
ah ok...
well thanks guys , bbl.
martin_: ncurses is a terminal-based library, hence it's used for command-line applications
how can I see what devices ( usb) are connected to my puter'
lsusb(1) reports all usb devices
from that you can deduce which are connected
there's also a program called usbview
(in universe)
ugh
wtf
this scanner is hooked up
but xsane cannot figure it out :(

tha_game|away:had any luck with dvdrip?
Chibifs?
tha_game|away: did you find any infromation on dvdrip or any other program that could take audio from a dvd.
hi @ all
'lo
http://kwiki.ffii.org/Cons041221En :)
tha_game|away: are you there?
Hi
i have a question: can I copy this sources (http://www.entropia.de/cms/pub/Main/LinuxStartSeite/sources.list.stable.internet) in my souces.list from ubuntu without any problems?
Anyone knows what "FATAL: Error inserting ndiswrapper (/lib/modules/2.6.9-1-386/kernel/drivers/net/ndiswrapper/ndiswrapper.ko): Invalid module format" means?
DoktorTomoe: what gave you that error?
hm, i tried to modprobe ndiswrapper (to get wlan)
hello?
DoktorTomoe: you're running Hoary?
lkerscher: one sec.
crimsun: Yes
okay thanks
DoktorTomoe: checked bugzilla?
crimsun: Where can I find it?
DoktorTomoe: linked from the Ubuntu web site
hey guys where can i get linspire??
anir: from Linspire's home page, of course.
Blackwell: I'm just trying to get this machine working :)
crimsun: i am looking for a free distro
anir: ubuntu is a free distro
need some help with extracting audio from a dvd, asked same question yesterday, some help offered from tha_game|away, but he doesn't seem to be online at the moment.
crimsun: i have to pay for linspire...why??
lkerscher: um, no, you cannot use that list in your sources.list without breaking many, many things.
adbak: can i get linspire for free?
hm fuck
and any party of thislist?
fender: do you have mplayer installed?
anir: i have no clue, but go to distrowatch.com and there's a little drop-down menu.  find linspire on it and it will tell you the website for linspire
anir: some companies make money off of putting together a very ease to use linux distribution. if you don't want to pay for them, that's ok.
can't get mplayer to work, or dvdrip or transcode or fffmpeg, real problem i'm having.
adbek: i searched.. it charges $20.. but i am from India.. so its impossible for me to pay
lkerscher: it's not a good idea to randomly add sources.
hey all u linux guys listen..
okay so I have to search some promgrams manually?
lkerscher: furthermore, those aren't necessary for Ubuntu, which includes most of those packages in either main, universe, or multiverse repos
i have seen some problems with linux...
can't get mplayer to work, or dvdrip or transcode or fffmpeg, real problem i'm having.
you guys should look into these
lkerscher: you should enable the universe and multiverse repos in Synaptic if you want some of those packages. Ubuntu already includes most of them.
hey guys
why Linux uses multiple GUI???
i have a question
hm and how to do that?
lkerscher: that package list was written for Debian Woody. Ubuntu Warty is much newer than Debian Woody.
anyone have any idea how to setup a Motorola SM56 PCI modem in ubuntu?
crimsun: for multiverse do you just copy the universe repo and replace uni- with multi-?
it seems that ubuntu recognises it under 'device settings'
lkerscher: follow the instructions for Restricted formats on the wiki.
listen to me..
anir: for choices.  some people like one over another.  some work better on older machines
anir: because people can't agree on a single one. if you want less choice, consider sticking to windows or better mac.
okay
thank you
adbak: you could do that, sure. You can also enable it in Synaptic.
i am not talking about me only.. i am talking about the average home users..
crimsun: but there is no multiverse repo when you install ubuntu.  you have to manually add it
the average home user will be pleased with GNOME 2.8
hence its selection as a default desktop for Warty
many of home pc users dont want to install linux because its less  user friendly..
adbak: that's the idea
adbak: it shouldn't be "installed" by default. A small subset of fully-supported packages is good.
the question is not Independence to CHOOSE its independence to NOT have to choose
anir: GNOME 2.8 is hardly user-friendly.
crimsun: yes, i agree, i was just trying to say that i can't enable it in synaptic cuz i don't have it in my sources.list
err, user-unfriendly.
adbak: it should be in your sources.list by default, just commented out
anir: if you don't want to choose, there are options you can...erh...choose that are good for that state of mind.
crimsun: this ndiswrapper problem is not mentioned in bugzilla. Given the information I have is relatively small ("does not work"), is in really good to file a bug report?
sorry but which is that wiki-adress?
anir: linux, in general, may be less user-friendly, but that gap is quickly being closed.  not to mention some (avg home users) are scared off because of the learning curve. they're used to their windows
lkerscher: also linked from Ubuntu's web site.
anir: you may have "standardization" in mind. i agree that standardization in the way of windows and mac os x is important and good. but you won't find many fans of that among unix people.
bsd people on the other hand....enjoy the fruits of standardization every single day, too.
DoktorTomoe: it's your call, really, but Hoary _is_ a moving target, and things are expected to break. You could wait a couple days and see if linux-image-2.6.9-1-386 is updated again.
crimsun: see .. an average user dont want to keep trying a newer version of OS everyother day.... what i get in KDE i get diferent feel in GNOME..
anir: do you expect the average user to try every available desktop environment?
anir: or do you think (s)he will stick with one that works, one that is aesthetically-pleasing, and one that is efficient?
anir: for instance, by choosing to try both KDE and GNOME, you've already crossed outside the definition of the "average" home user. Your expectations of the "average" home user thus are irrelevant.
crimsun:..indeed they dont..well i want to solve problems with the computer.. not create.. right..
anir: What exactly is your problem in choosing one of the GUIs?
anir: Just choose the one which most of the applications you want to use are written for. That's KDE for me,
anyone have any idea how to setup a Motorola SM56 PCI modem in ubuntu?
crimsun: thats what i am trying to say.. i am confused which one suits me best..there are so many linux os.. but without any stahdard..like for eg.. windows or OS x uses only one GUI
anir: I didn't want to sound harsh or impolite, but I really do not understand your problem...
anir: that is the problem with linux. if you don't like so much choice...there isn't much that can be done about it.
doktortomoe: i am trying 3 different linux os from last one week or so.. in search of which one suits me best.. but why should i invest all the time??
blackwell: do u think its good?
anir: If you actually have been trying 3 different distributions (please do not call them OS), why have you done it?
coz this time i had the time..why should someone who is busy like hell should do it doktortomoe
anir: if the abundance of choices is not pleasing, you can always accept the defaults
anir: to have choice? yes, to have choice is good. however, in the java software development field there is often too much (dubious) choice, and it actually hurts people. what you should consider perhaps it to ignore everything that is not mainstream. that helps to cut away of lot of first level choices.
anir: Actually, I am busy like hell (IT Freelancer), but I know what I want, and how to get it. And I know how to obtain the software I need. Therefore, I do not really invest time, unless I think it is important.
anir: you seem to assume that all the linux distros out there are made for one particular group of users. that is however not so. if you are in a hurry, you don't have time to learn something new. so let a consultant tell you what you need or get what you already know. if you are unhappy with the stuff you already know...linux is in the box of options again.
anir: Important could mean "hazzlefree in respect of malware" for John User
guys i think lindows is a good choice for me.. but i dont want to invest some money to try it..
now comes ELX..
anir: then don't. don't buy the cat in the sack.
(as we say in germany)
anir: besides, who will help you with lindows? lindows is by far, far, far NOT linux mainstream.
anir: See, this is choice - you choose not to. now you have options left. (btw: any other germans in here?=
anir: in other words: you are about to get yourself a freak linux distro. i advise against that.
guys... guys.... let it go... i'm sure the man can make his own choices
blackwell: is lindows is not good???
you should never have to pay for a linux ..
anir: do you know anyone who uses it?
etorix: bullshit
anir: Lindows would be the WindowsXP of Linux if SuSE wasn't in existance.
chill dudes
anir: if you want a popular distro that does not offer much choice and is user-friendly, try Fedora (http://fedora.redhat.com) or Mandrake
if the distro is good and meets your requirements, it can be easily worth twice the price of an xp server license. :)
etorix_: I really am willing to pay for a linux if it was well configured for my needs.
so am i
DoktorTomoe: right on :)
so was i...when i decided to buy mandrake...
and then i found out they don't have any "pay on delivery" options in germany. :)
etorix_: my time is valuable too, and if I save more on time than on linux, I'll get my money
Hi all. anybody know how to upgrade to Firefox 1.0 ?
but the problem i am getting here is .. i have not been able to play mpeg4  files in UBUNTU..in other one i may not be able to run DVD
You would have to use Hoary
i repeat .. you should never have to pay for a linux ..
Hutch192: I just downloaded it from firefox and ran the installer as root...
etorix_: this seems kinda off-topic
hutch192: go to there site
anir: wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
anir: it's in the FAQ...
bob2: i have done everything given there
Anyone use a easy to use powerful CMS that would be good for a personal site?
anir: Where is the problem? I got vlc installes pretty easy. It now plays virtually any file format.
anir: I can play mpeg-4 files fine
anir: what do you use to play movies?
DoktorTomoe: so did i. but i turned to be version 0.9.6
Tyche: drupal is kinda cool, but php
Hutch: you might want to change the link firefox in /usr/bin
doktortomoe: i have vlc too.. it too does not play anything.. says the pulgin needed to handle the movie is not available
bye
anir: have you tried gxine?
anir: are you sure you installed correctly?
DoktorTomoe: i did that too.
yes i did
DoktorTomoe: i mean if there is a .deb package for ff 1.0
PHP is good thing, bob2
i tried totem-xine and vlc
anir: can you paste the output of 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'?
Tyche: in insecure-land, maybe ;-)
Hutch192: Which directory did you install ff 1.0 to? (I am not aware of an ff1.0-deb)
bob2, and what is a good secure alternative? asp? =)
DoktorTomoe: /usr/local/Firefox/
Hutch192: ubuntu-backport should have it.... i think.
Tyche: have you heard of PERL?
Tyche: perl, python, ruby
Hutch192: there's Ffx 1.0 in the ubuntu bakcports repo
erk, I really wouldn't trust the 'backports' repository
Hutch192: what's the killer feature 1.0 has that you want?
DoktorTomoe: Yea, do I know how to use it. No. Is there a CMS that would use any of those?
they work fine on all the machines I have used them on
bob2: how will i get the output? in the terminal?
anir: yes.
which would be 9 machines all running stock warty
Tyche: zope uses python
bob2: RSS.
Tyche: and there are a number of CMS'es built on top of Zope
like plone!
I don;t see the reason to bash projects that are meant to give people access to the applications they want.
zenwhen: I'm not bashing anything, I'm just a bit concerned about how it started
bob2: can u type the command again plz
03:45:03           bob2 | anir: can you paste the output of 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'?
like Plone indeed, or CPS, or Silva (disclaimer: I work for Infrae, the company that made Silva)
Hm, anyone got an idea how I change a distro on a webserver remotely? (Dont want suse, want debian)
bob2, I was just stating that the backports project hosts some quality debs.
No biggie. :P
DoktorTomoe: you don't
is there a space between libavcodec2 and | and tail ?? bob2
anir: doesn't matter
its says command not found bob2
zenwhen: well, if you say so...
anir: er, are you sure you didn't make a typo?
bob2: I thought I've seen it before. I didn't care at that point of time, however.
off hand does anyone know the correct sources.list for debian unstable?
DoktorTomoe: there's debtakeover, but I really really wouldn't do that on a machine that's actually needed

2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: 1.0.6 should be new ""enough"". Any reason you need Sid/Hoary's 1.0.7?
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	anir	bob2: bash: dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1?: command not found
2005-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	crimsun	(fwiw, there are a few alsa-lib problems with 1.0.7)
2005-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	bob2	anir: I didn't type that

2005-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: are you referring to alsa-driver or alsa-lib?

2005-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	krischan	guys, an XMMS-related question: how do I enable XMMS to play back MIDI files? I heard about the 'xmms-midi' plugin, but I can't find it in Ubuntu's repos.
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	anir	bob2: can u help me?
2005-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	andy	hi guys... i just installed Ubuntu onto my pismo powerbook and during installation I made my ethernet port the default networking port.  however it didn't seem to install support for my airport card though.  how do i go about installing that as well?
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	Blackwell	anir: you can have someone remotely look over your shoulder, too, in case this is somehow not working out.
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	Blackwell	pick someone willing to help and make sure to only allow looking, not actual controlling of your desktop.
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	bob2	andy: just load the airport module and then use iwconfig
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	Blackwell	bbl
2005-01-01T07:03:00.000Z	anir	blackwell: will u help me?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	03:54:26           bob2 | 03:47:48           bob2 | 03:45:03           bob2 | anir: can you paste the output of 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	bob2	run that command
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	is there an unofficial ubuntu website that people find to be helpufl?
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	adbak	krischan: i don't know what plugin is needed for xmms, but tse3play is a midi players
2005-01-01T07:04:00.000Z	andy	bob2: how do I find the airport module? via terminal?
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	anir	bob2: when i copy and paste everything.. from 03:54...till -nl'?.. it gives command not found
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	andy: modprobe airport, yes
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	andy	thanks :)
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	andy: dude, you're not copying what I wrote
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	adbak	youre welcome
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	er, anir
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	crimsun	macewan: it is not recommended that you randomly add the Sid binary packages line to /etc/apt/sources.list. Much weeping and gnashing of teeth may ensue. Instead, you may be able to grab the package from Sid's pool manually and install it.
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	bob2	anir: please just cut and paste it carefully
2005-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	anir	bob2: whtever i am typing it says command not found..
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	andy	bob2: huh? not copying it?
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	adbak	do you need to be superuser?
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	andy: not talking to you
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	bob2	adbak: no
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	andy	lol, k
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	adbak	bob2, you have your hands full
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	adbak	:
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	adbak	:)
2005-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	Tyche	Thanks for your feedback.
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	Tyche	I'm going to download and do some testing on these CMS. Are any of them in warty?
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	drupal is
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	anir	thats why i dont want to use linux
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	just stayaway from the *nukes
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	anir	it makes u frastrated
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	anir: well, you're not copying what I said
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	Tyche	anir it is worth it.
2005-01-01T07:07:00.000Z	bob2	the command I showed you to use works fine
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	anir	bob2: i am simply copying it
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	etorix_	worked here too
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	Tyche	bob2, agreed I don't like the *nukes.
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	bob2	anir: well, I'm not sure what's going on then, since it works for me and etorix_, and what you're showing me is not what I typed
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	andy	bob2: sorry to be a pain, but ""modprobe airport"" didn't seem to do anything
2005-01-01T07:08:00.000Z	etorix_	un  libavcodec2    <none>         (no description available)
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	Tyche	bob2, Still learning debian. Once I install drupal, where do I find docs? Or where did it get installed to?
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	anir	bob2: do i have to use 'sudo'?
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	andy: it just loads the module, then you need to configure it...
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	andy: no
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	bob2	anir: no
2005-01-01T07:09:00.000Z	crimsun	Tyche: /usr/share/doc/drupal/* ?
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	bob2	andy: 'iwconfig' is the command you want
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	bassinboy	Chibifs?
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	CheeseMapping	I'm about to make one of those snap decisions.  should be fun
2005-01-01T07:10:00.000Z	anir	bob2:i will paste.....03:54:26           bob2 | 03:47:48           bob2 | 03:45:03           bob2 | anir: can you paste the output of 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'?...then i will press enter..right?
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	anir: no, just the bit I put in quotes
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Cheese	Does ubuntu have good package management?
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	if you don't understand something someone says to you, it's much much much much easier if you just say so
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	etorix_	apt
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	crimsun	Cheese: excellent. It's based on Debian.
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	Cheese: of course, it's based on Debian
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	etorix_	i <3 apt
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Cheese	great. I'm SO there.
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	CheatersRealm, yea... ubuntuforums
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Cheese	time to snag an ISO and a CD
2005-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	anir	bob2:okay i will paste.... 'dpkg -l libavcodec2 | tail -n1'? and  press enter...okay this time??
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Cheese	Debian irritated me because the liveCD and actual install didn't support my 160gb hd for no apparent reason.
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	bob2	debian doesn't have a live cd
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Cheese	the install disc is one
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	CheatersRealm	thx nomasteryoda
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	bob2	no it's not
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	etorix_	harddly
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	np
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Tyche	crimsun: It is there, thank you. Doesn't say anything about the debian install. Does synaptic just put it on the machine and then you install it like the instructions say? moving and copying, setting up DB, etc.
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	bob2	anir: without the quotes, yes
2005-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	Cheese	it boots into linux to install. imo, it's a livecd
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	bob2, noobs
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	etorix_	no its not
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Tyche: I presume so; the README*s will be more helpful.
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	bob2	nomasteryoda: 'noobs'?
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	Cheese	course, by that definition, that'd make everything a liveCD, so that probobly is wrong
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	crimsun	Cheese: a live CD is more along the lines of Knoppix or Ubuntu's livecd or MandrakeMove
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	anir	bob2:  okay i am giving you the out put..
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	anir	bob2: tail: 1?: invalid number of lines
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	anir	No packages found matching libavcodec2.
2005-01-01T07:13:00.000Z	bob2	ok then
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	Cheese	crimsun, I present to you the following: Gentoo calls their install discs liveCDs
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	crimsun	Cheese: good thing this isn't Gentoo (the distro), eh? :)
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	Tyche	cruimsun: Thanks, I will keep searching.
2005-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	anir	so bob2 what should i do?
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	Cheese: gentoo says lots of things that may or may not be sensible ;-)
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	Cheese	bob2: very true
2005-01-01T07:15:00.000Z	nomasteryoda	bob2, the Debian ""liveCD"
anir: erm, I think you should read wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats again and make sure you followedthe instructions correctly
crimsun: compiling everything was a learning experience.  I learned that on a 450mhz box it takes a while, and that the Gentoo_Mirrors aren't always up to date
that gets REALLY old REALLY fast
that's better.
bob2: do i need to install libavcodec2?
wow. I'm getting a fast torrent too!
once I installed new network modules in XP it stopped blue-screening after 20 mins
blah. XP.
guys why did you say that lindows is not linux?
hi all
anir: you really followed all the instructions on that page?
yes i did bob2
well, I'm not sure what to suggest...I followed them and can play mpeg-4 fine
bob2: let me check again..
Doesn;t Lindows run as root?
Doesn't*
everything, yes
ha
yeah, Id say thats good enough of a reason to say its not quite Linux alone
They should have named it Linux 98 instead
under which section i will see bob2
anir: see what?
for mpeg4 files.. under wiki/restricted formats
er, didn't you say you'd already read it?
i will participate as translator for Ubuntu linux in my native language czech
how i contact responsible preson ?
netmole, look for rosetta, if you want
you can translate projects there directly
netmole: Are there any ubuntu-specific czech Web pages etc.?
i want to try lindows but
lets what this has to offer..
its good if its windows like
no i didnt see nothing
linspire..
netmole: the ubuntu-doc list would be a good place to talk to people about that
i order cd by cd shipping system
ok
i go there
bob2: what is the meaning of there is no plugin to handle the movie??
anir: you need to provide waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay more context
but if you can't play a movie generally, don't expect to be able to play it in a browser
anir: you haven't read the information on the site if you don't know that
I'd suggesting reading the wiki page again and making sure you've understood it all
anir: "These formats are patent-encumbered. If you do not require compatibility with MPEG-4 players, consider Ogg Theora."
i have too see in " where to get other legally  questionable package" ..bob2 scizzo
<scizzo> anir: "These formats are patent-encumbered
oh
you need to read the section on the page that explains how to install mplayer or gxine or such
anir: maybe you should start to learn about patent and stuff also
i hope software patents in europe to stay as now, illegal
;)
do i need to install libdvdcss2??
because otherways it's a chaos
if you want to play dvds, yes
have you really read that page?
we can't help you unless you tell us what you're doing
no i want to play only vcds..bob2
a vcd does not contain mpeg-4
bob2: i have installed w32codecs
OMG!
i want to play mpg files.. bob2
anir: 1. add the sources to synaptic
anir: 2. reload the package information
anir: 3. Search for the packages mentioned on the wiki
anir: okease just tell us if you've read the page or not
Anyone is running Warty on a server machine? I'm considering to replace my Woody with Warty on my main server.
anir: 4. Mark them and install them....and try to play things again
I want to install JDK. What is the better location for it. And where is it better to update environment?
eim: yes
bob2: Works fine?
scizzo: its given only for mplayer..nothing for totem
yes
anir: the page explains that, too
totem-xine
i have installed totem-xine bob2
bob2: Fine. I'm deciding between reinstalling the whole system or just upgrading to Warty.
guys let me tell you .. i am trying to play a file with .dat extension
hello thar
can anybody please help me installing a new theme in ubuntu that i've downloaded from gnome-look ?
anir: try in console totem file.dat
i dont know what the heck i am doing... i am totally lost..
trukulo: tell me how
open a console
anyone?
terminal, if you understand it
trukulo: how do i open a console?
yes terminal
rhodan: open System -> Desktop preferences -> theme
in terminal
write totem /path/to/file.dat
where /path/to , is where you have .dat
then trukulo
trukulo: yes I have been there, but when I select the file i downloaded nothing happens
trukulo nothing is working
help: i installed bittornado and i downloaded a quake3 torrent and it wont run
rhodan, do you see: "install theme" button?
anir, what error do you have?
whats the url to get new gnome themes??
ACID|net, art.gnome.org is one of them
truluko: yes
rhodan, use it
trukulo.. now its playing
trukulo: but i have to tell the picture quality is not as good as XP pro
trukulo: tried, does not work
rhodan, what file do you have? tar.gz or tar.bz2 ?
trukulo: tar.gz
anir, why it's better?
rhodan, look in detailed
what's theme for? gtk? metacity? icons?
trukulo: i dont know why.. i am an unbiased commentator
anir, in my system i can see it very well
trukulo: thank you it now loaded the theme, however the icons do not load, do they have to go anywhere specific ? it's gtk2
icons are another download
Are the python-fixedpoint and python-mpz packages being permanently removed from Hoary?
themes are separated in three, gtk, metacity and icons
trukulo: ok, but in this archive file there is a directory called icons
but i think it's for controls
try open nautilus
trukulo:may be i need some plugins
??
and look control icons (open, save...)
anir, if it works, it works
don't know what your problems are, need more feedback if you want help
trukulo: thank u very much
you're wellcome
its a headache that everytime i have to download  from the net
nowif i dont have internet connection... i cant use ubuntu??
that means ububtu is only for the net connected poeples??
hi to all
plz comment guys
ubuntu owns!
finally a debian distro without the headaches
owns??
xelerated: think you dont have internet connection.. is it worth having Ubuntu??
yes its worth it
to an extent linux  sux
...
xelerated: how??
and to a greater extent windows sucks
No version of linux is all that great without an internet connection
anir, what if you have only a windows cd a unplugged computer?
do you think windows is good?
xelerated: how will you get the softwares if you dont have net connected??
anir, what do you mean how? you can do word processing, lots of games, all sorts of stuff
Windows is by far a better option if you dont have an internet connection
you are on line right now.... why not download it now
JStrike, how? playing solitaire and writing with wordpad?
xelerated: i can atleast play movie, play games and do all sort of things without downloading any softwares from the net in windows
yea and i can play movies and play all sorts of games in linux without getting online
anir: now you're starting to define the issue :)
anir: the problem here is that, for various reasons, FOSS is locked out of a lot of multimedia formats and protocols
anir, what games? solitaire and pinball? great
but in ububtu i have to download from the net only to configure my system...
trukulo : What are you on about? No. If you buy a cd, or someone gives you a program, with dependency resolution, linux is pretty useless
anir: sure, try playing .ogm files in a fresh windows xp install
anir: so in large part, we cannot use these things easily on linux
JStrike, if anyone gives you a program for windows, that depends on directx9b , and you don't have it... what?
anir: for the more technically minded, there are ways around this, but it involves downloading software because none of it can be shipped with Ubuntu itself for legal reasons
it's the same problem
take for example ... i am downloading 200MB from yesterday..
i agree with jdub
problems you're talking about have patent and copyright problems
trukulo: thanks for your help with the theme
trukulo : Seems to come with almost anything that needs it
in ubuntu you have alternatives, just use them
anir: are you using warty or hoary?
JStrike, i disagree
jdub i am using warty
you are talking about windows AND a lot of software installed after installation
anir: ok, so those are the initial security updates available for warty
software, that it's system separatedly distributed
and belive me.. it requires a lot of time to do this..
JStrike, windows never has the tools I need, internet connection or not.
anir, but it's only one time installation, upgrades are clean
but see in windows.. you will get all the required software in the installing cd only
jdub, he's talking about marillat repos
anir: you get all the required software from the CD only with ubuntu too, but you have additional needs
in samba client, i want to change a directory which has spares - how do i do it??? IMPORTANT
tritium : I haven't used windows in a long time, but back then, I never came across dependency issues, such as you will have on linux without an internet connection
thats why people hasitates to install linux.. as my rommie said
JStrike, if you have repos on cd's with depends, you have no problems
same as windows
programs in windows come with depends
trukulo : Rubish
JStrike, you were just less aware of the DLL hell under the hood with windows
JStrike, think what you want
i dont know.. but other than being a bit stable...i dont find any advantages in linux over windows
anir, perhaps, you need to read more about linux then
If someone hands you a cd with a modern game, you can be pretty sure it will run on windows. Not the same with linux
anir: that's ok :)
what about free software advantage?
JStrike, try installing yahoo messenger or something similar without the latest Internet Explorer if you want dependency hell in windows
i was just showing a buddy an advantage of my linux box over his windows box, my weather monitor gives me everything his does, but i dont see add's or popups
And that is not even bringing in the problem with different distros using different versions of libraries
JStrike, it's a problem of support in game companys
hope we will get something better linux in the near future which will solve the problems... but till then..
You wont find the advantages if you are only using oyur computer for email web browsing and games, and dont care about security or automation.
I dont have windows, but I am talking about 6-7 years ago when I did
why is this a linx vs windows discussion? we are all in here because we experienced the fact that linux is better then windows... lets move on
JStrike, then go back windows if you want, i'm really happy with linux
now Window is coming with LongHorn... its great..
If you donlt see why Linux is a superior platform, you haven;t looked hard enough.
hmmm, " " :D
anir, why is it great?
yea, if i didnt care one bit about security, id use windows. But i do care about security, and wont touch windows other than to play an occasional game
anir, what compilers and libraries does Longhorn come with?
dudes, let's leave the windows vs. linux argument please
anir, longhorn will be great for people who will also never understand why it is a inferior platform.
jdub, ok
i have just tried transformation package in XP pro... looks great.. feels great.. and most of all  easy to handle.. and i found it very very stable
SERVER: ncn.ircxpro.com | Help Assistants & Global Ops Wanted |
trukulo : Why should I go back to windows. I was merely stating that you cant tell someone new to linux that it doesn't have those issues
SERVER: ncn.ircxpro.com | Help Assistants & Global Ops Wanted |
SERVER: ncn.ircxpro.com | Help Assistants & Global Ops Wanted |
now the ball is in your court LINUX..
actually i think longhorn might be halfway decent, since they are taking a more serious approch to security, but im sture they will still botch it some
anir: enoug thanks.
xelerated: enough please.
The solution to problems with linux for newbies is for them to use it long enough not to be newbies.
I dont want linux dumbed down to the point where control is taken away.
linux will only really work when OEMs start installing it
or at least offering it
what happened guys.. say something
which will only work when microsoft become less anti-competitive
zenwhen: 'control' and what you're calling 'dumbed down' aren't related.
xelerated: no version of windows will be halfway decent until it is a Windows linux distribution
ACID|net, |QuaD-: enough please.
????
anir: jdub anir: enoug thanks. <- thats why
jdub: i was trying to stop the convo
hm... when I plug my usb cam, where will it normally mount?
jdub, new users will complain about Linux until it is windows.
|QuaD-: a comment like that is not a conversation stopper.
jdub: read above
Simira, look under /media
tritium: nope, only cdroms
|QuaD-: i did, thus my comment.
read my comment before that
Simira, hmm, not for me...usbstick, zip, etc under media
hey all
Simira: camera? it won't mount, it's not a storage device.
tritium: my usb-stick mounts there
|QuaD-: i reacted to your last comment.
anyone know how to get java working in hoary?
jdub: it stores my pics :p
guys its nothing about inferrior platform.. tell me why till date more people use windows??
jdub: how do I mount it then?
Simira: ah, not a webcam ;) it may not have mounted
Simira, not all cameras are usb-storage
anir, please, stop
anir, I am pretty sure youare trolling.
anir: there is no need to continue this discussion.
jdub: no, my digital one, got a replacement for the stolen one today
tritium: this should be
So just stop, or leave. This isnt #defendlinux.
i am not against linux.. i want to use it and i want it to be better..
now why dont you listen
anyone know how to get java working in hoary?
anir: we're listening, just keep it on-topic please.
anir: try another channel, please, this is for ubuntu support for users
anon26: installed the java packages?
or open me a query if you want
anon26: www.ubuntuguide.com
sorry guys...
well there are so many i don't know which ones to go with
anon26, look for java in wiki
Simira: is gnome-volume-manager running?
i loved ubuntu.. and did not want to leave it.. thats why i hope that it gives me more..
anon26: if you are using hoary, you should be able to make an educated decision on which you like the best
there's a howto
anon26: searcj for java, and read the description. It's fairly easy
jdub: yes
anir: what did you leave it for?
Anyone here install and running Drupal?
whats the best way to do a complete system backup in ubuntu??  Is it ghost?
Tyche, me
coz i cant run my windows progs here..
anir, did you install wine?
anir: want me to help you figure out alternative linux progs?
Anir, more people use Linux because Microsoft is a corrupt monopoly that pushes any and all competitors out of the limelight. Dell doesnt sell desktops wiht Linux because Microsoft would raise their price to Dell. It has nothing to do with quality. It has everything to do with the fact that most people have not even heard of Linux. Ubuntu aims to change that. There will alays be adjustment when switching platforms. You just have to
get used to the diffrences and read some guides.
anir, of course you can't, the same you can't run mac or linux programs on windows
zenwhen: dude, seriously, enough.
I meant more people use Windows.
sorry jdub
Oh ok
trukulo: I just installed it from warty. Now, do I need to follow the readme? Or did it do the database and copying stuff?
anir, open me a query if you want
I was simply trying to enlighten him.
zenwhen: after you'd been asked to stop.
Tyche, particullary, i prefer to install drupal from tar.gz, not package
anir, I can help you install wine.  It can run many, but not all, windows applications.
Oh, I hadnt seena nything directed towards me. Sorry.
it's newer version and more... control?
thanks guys
zenwhen: it was directed to the channel.
oh ok
tritium: or we can help him find equivalent OSS linux packages
tritium i have installed WINE
quad: plz
jdub, is the channel support only?
anir, okay, just makeing sure
anir: what programs do you need?
making sure
i am missing my windows games that i used to play quad
zenwhen: no, but off-topic discussion is unnecessary here.
anir: thats the only thing we really can't help you with, unless you like ut2k4 or doom3 :)
jeff, perhaps you can post a channel for off-topic discussions on topic
jdub: i beg an apology
it's an idea
anyone got experience configuring ubuntu as an Internet Gateway for a bunch of Windows machines (DSL)?
trukulo: So actually go out and download the drupal and go at it as if it wasn't installed in warty.
Every time anyone trues to talk about anything other than support, they are threatened. I thought discussion of Linux was on topic. I'll just stop talking unless I can help someone I suppose.
tries*
quad: hmm..
Tyche, yes, that's what i do
trukulo: there is the entire rest of the internet available for non-ubuntu discussion...
sure jdub, but it would help things like this
trukulo: Okay, thank you. Can I check out your site?
i said it was only an idea
Tyche, badopi.org
trukulo thank you
see let us come together to make ubuntu better..
better than anyother
anir: so there are programs around that will help you run windows software on linux (generally not games), but these are for special cases. in general, there's no point switching to linux while continuing to use windows software.
for example, if you're installing ubuntu and it detects two NICs, does it further probe and find the DSL connection?
trukulo: hehe, cannot read it, but looks good. That is what I was looking for. Thank you.
anir, i know it's difficult to understand, but if you wanna help, that's not the way
you can send suggests to bugzilla ubuntu
Tyche, it's spanish :)
warty.iso --> 100% download complete! :)
anir, there are different opinions of what would be better.  I don't play video games, so the ability to play windows games wouldn't make ubuntu better for me...
tritium: but for the rest 50% people it will be.. why only think about yourself
anir, we can't do more than we do
anir, I'm not.  I'm thinking about those that don't care about games.
if companys make games for linux, then superb
anir: people work on what's important to them.
How do I get into MySQL if I have never used the base install from warty? Do I need to change the password for root, since the root password isn't working?
tritium, however, sometimes being able to review a document in actual MS-Word is required - Open Office is great, but MSW paginates things differently, for example
ok guys, I will see you all tomorrow
Quenyar, ???
Tyche: the root account is disabled, use sudo.
bye
take care
tritium: suppose u work in php and i work with java.. so it will be better if it supports both..isnt it
Quenyar, paginates on word dependes on printer
jdub how do I sudo mysql? sudo mysql -u <myusername> -p?
tritium - a reason to run wine to run a typical windows app not related to games
anir, normally, people who develop in linux don't mind about commercial games
Quenyar, okay...
anir: games that you would want to play are usuall closed source, so it is more up to the developers
they develop what they need/like
jdub: I get and ERROR 2202: Can't connect to local MySQL server through socket
jdub: That is when I enter in my password.
Tyche, do you have mysql-server installed?
anyone on who has experience in configuring multiple NICs, iptables, routing, etc?
trukulo: checking...
jdub, i'll help tyche, stay working
Tyche, open me a query if you want
anir, I'm more of a minimalist.  I'd prefer the intersection, rather than the union, of users' needs.
Then let users customize beyond that.
trukulo: No, I don't. Installing mysql-server now. Sorry to have bother you jdub. Didn't know you were working on another thing.
Tyche, don't worry, if you need help, i'm here
trukulo: Okay, now I am getting access denied when logging in with my username.
Tyche, ok, what command do you use exactly? post here
Tyche: did you add the user name to the server?
create a database?
etc?
rather than searching for YOUR linux.. if one linux can satisfy both of us.. then only we can say its ubuntu..i am not talking about game only.. that was only an example..if linux continues this devident procedure..i mean different distro for different user.. it can never beat windows.. coz see in a company..some 10000 people uses a computer.. so will you make 10000 linux.. because of the fact that 10000 different individual have different need and they like
to work on different polatforms
trukulo: I have done nothing, besides install mysql-server and then try to get in using: sudo mysql -u <myusername> -p
tyche: in <username> , use root
anir: as much as linux distros deviate, many factors stay the same for compatibility reasons
root is default user for mysqld
and there's no password
so don't use -p
trukulo: Nice work!
think about it guys.. coz i am a corporate guy and handle 10000 IT pro.. i am still using windows..
Tyche, add a password in mysql
thats a 0 more its 1000
sudo mysqladmin -u root password
anir: your point?
anir, you think ppl here don't know about corporate enviroments?
quad: my point is that we have to give extensive training to any freshers that joins in linux..
no trukulo my point was not to hurt anyone
and these are the people whom you call IT Pros?
anir, please, stay on topic :)
installing ubuntu on my Mom's Inspiron 8200 (Dell)
heh
anir: people like what they are used to, whats your point. The university i work at (4th largest private institution in the USA) supports linux
ppl please, stop arguing about this
does she know?
turns out it had a bad hard drive
use #ubuntu-argue or something similar
anir... go to #ubuntu-offtopic
or better: #ubuntu-flame
whoa, arguing?  I missed a flame war?
heh
trukulo: I'
darn.  knew I should have lurked here.
occy: someone trying to tell us how windows is superior
anir, You overlook the fact that a standard windows installation does not include many of the tools that come standard in any linux distro.
ppl, please: #ubuntu-flame
Does anyone know if Ubuntu supports Motorola SM56 PCI modems?
trukulo: Sorry, meant to say. I'm going to go download drupal now and install. See if I can get it working per the installation readme.
Tyche, ok, tyche
and the fact is that total cost of linux is more than that of windows
anir: go to ubuntu-offtopic for this
sorry quad
that's enough, guys
go get em' bob2
i am leaving.. seems like i become a pain in ass.. sorry all
anir, I'd be careful callilng that a "fact"
haha... i guess you aren't coming to #ubuntu-offtopic
Does anyone know if Ubuntu supports Motorola SM56 PCI modems?
calling
anir, join #ubuntu-offtopic
[Phaedrus] : try asking on the user list
Hi
bob2, still didn't get it installed on this lappie.  that odd reason I metioned.  but it's installling now on an 8200 inspiron
seems to be going well so far.
will do bob
are there still daily builds of ubuntu?
or was that a pre 1.0 release thing
occy: isn't that hoary?
there are daily hoary cds, aiui
Can i ask something ?
|QuaD-: ahhh it is?
FuMaNcHu, try
occy: i believe... hoary is the most uptodate version
ahh ok.
hoary is development version, unstable
bbs
yes, and bleeding edge
Ok, i have mouse problem, it works just fine on the live cd, but it doesnt work at all on the installed ubuntu
im on a hoary
etorix: :)

How can i fix that
FuMaNcHu, in X ?
Yep

hello
hi
someone can help me?
atlas95: instead of asking that, state your question
i've error message when I launch program for resolution, I'm french I donr't know the name in english
fumachu: look in .xsession-errors at your home
atlas95: mon francais et horrible
Anyone had the same problem with that?
more franglais than anything
the X server don't support the extesion XRandR
atlas95: i don't understand
(it's my translation of my error in french)
erf
i have this message when I launch : gnome-display-propertie
Ill check it out and get back
Thanks trukulo
you're wellcome fumanchu
Where r u from?
spain
this bot is crazy
He! I found the error in english :
he XServer does not support the XRandR extension.  Runtime resolution
changes to the display size are not available.
you can help me now?
you can't change resolution in X
and why :s ?
your graphic card seems not to support it
don't know, need more feedback
it's a radeon 9600 pro
it support
before this work but since yesterday :s ?
do you use warty or hoary?
i don't know why...
wary
warty*
if I try hoary this can work?
don't try hoary
it's problematic for newbie ppl
installing grub...
hoary breaks every so often
do you changed anything? installed new programs? help me to help you
I have installed firefox 1.0
whit "depot" backport
anyone here use bittornado?
and other programs, for example I have try to install nforce driver but they don't work
atlas95, that's the problem then
things you've installed
i have installed ati driver too but it is a big che**
try to quit that backport
how?
and make : aptitude update; aptitude dist-upgrade, you know
you have installed things that can break it
perhaps your drivers are bad for ubuntu
cool beans.  Got base installed.
grabbing updates now
backport is disable
i have juste install last gaim and firefox whit it
and they work....
:o(
and the drivers
man... this stinks when I can get my Mom's laptop to work with Ubuntu but not mine.
heh
anyone have any idea why my loki games don't have sound under ubuntu?
billytwowilly: do other things have sound?
my other problem is ; I have once time "save my session" when I have quit my computer and now whenever I reboot my program save start :s but I don't want :(
occy, yah, all other stuff has sound.
I think it may have to do with esd in gnome?
billytwowilly, maybe you need to disable the sound server before running the games?
billytwowilly: hmmm, perhaps, but have you checked aumix  or a mixer to make sure all levels are up and set right?
tritium, how would I do that?
occy, When I run mplayer I have to pass it -ao esd
billytwowilly: yeah, tritium could be right.
billytwowilly, System->Preferences->Sound
noone was answering so I was just guessing :)
billytwowilly, I'm using Hoary.  I hope your menu is setup the same way...
tritium, there is an "enable sound server at startup" but no "shut down sound server"
tritium, I'm running hoary too;)
billytwowilly, good deal
billytwowilly, right, but you can disable it.  You can kill the currently running server manually
ok trukulo i try this thx :)
ok
tritium, how would I kill it?
billytwowilly, ps ax | grep esd
that will show you the process
then kill #
grrr. grub error 18
max cyl exceeds the max supported by bios
wassup
this sounds a bit like the error debian had where it couldn't figure out my 160gb hd
ixane: play a bit with the LBA settings of your BIOS ;)
this is an older computer
billytwowilly, did you get it?
ixane, that computer support that big hds?
it's worked in other distros :/
debian is the only one that has had a problem with it.
the problem was that it ran into that 137 gb limit.
ixane, knows nothing about it, i'm poor, my hd is 30gb
trukulo: this was a freebie :)
the old hd was 10gb
but in any case, it's annoying.
ixane: its pretty sure solvable with other LBA settings, but if your BIOS doesnt support it :(
perhaps I can manually enter in the geom in my bios
uhh
and LBA is supported btw
ixane: so try switching it if there are different options
the only options I see are LBA, NORMAL, and LARGE
for verious things
various*
ixane: what was set up ?
LBA
Normal didn't work
ixane: so try large
I'm about to try large
heh
wait for it...
wait for it...
it says 'GRUB loading, please wait...' and my floppy drive light came on, but there it sits...
hmm
and my keyboard won't respond.  Caps and Numlock won't do anything
quite bad
ixane, try config bios in related USB things
legacy USB , i think
trukulo, A) it's already on B) it's an IDE drive, so how would USB help?
and a PS/2 keyboard
maybe I have to reinstall
grub was set up with it set to LBA
ixane, that's about keyboard lock
oh
ixane: shouldnt matter for the mbr
lets see if it'll detect the full HD size with the config set to normal
good idea
in the install I mean
gimp 2.2 in hoary?
odd though.  No distro except for debian based ones has had a problem with it
and I've tried a few
What's the digital camera situation like on Ubuntu these days?  I'm thinking about buying a Canon SD300 camera, but I haven't found any information about whether or not it plays well with Linux in general and Ubuntu in particular.
bborkk : Look at gphoto.org
sorry
hell. I probobly have to make a boot partition that's before cyl 1024
bborkk: a400 and a75 work..... not sure about SD300, but with a little luck canon uses the same protocol eveywhere
w00p, it installed and even X is working
hows ubuntu for using it as a webserver?
Captain_Obvious, fine, I'm told
personally, I would rather use Debian for server duties
Captain_Obvious: try www.freedesktop.org :)
Captain_Obvious: look at www.ubuntulinux.org it seems to cope good with the userbase
Ribs: why that ?
hey
because Debian is well suited for the task. Ubuntu is more of a desktop distro.
I'm not saying there is anything wrong with Ubuntu, it's great for what it is. But I personally would rather use Debian
what apt mirror do i use for packages found in for instance.. the PLF?
AFAIU one reason to prefer Ubuntu to Debian on a server is that Debian woody is 2 years old, and Debian sarge does not have security updates
Ribs: how did you get this idea ? ubuntu is debian under the hood....with a lot improvements debian will see way later....ever tried a custom install of ubuntu ?
I am aware it's based on Debian, but has a lot of extras that I would never consider on a server. And no, I haven't tried a custom installation.
well, atm i have one comp and it'll be both a server and a desktop
Ribs: supposedly the ubuntu developers use it as a server
that's it. I'm done playing games with the installer.  I'm going to do a custom install
hopefully that'll actually work
Ribs: you get a slim (200mb) base system, nothing else, then you can add your server stuff
i should be getting a comp soon for use as a server
*shrug*, like I said. It's personal preference
and im going to be installing the new distro this weekend
Captain_Obvious: the new distro?
which will probably be ubuntu
oh
hello there
hopefully i get the computer soon
hi folks
Rico:what's the diffrance? same version of apache and if you want to computer stable then install on it only what you need
Hey guys. I just did an install of Ubuntu last night. What's the easiest way to upgrade Firefox from 0.9.3 to 1.0?
are there any problems installing kde on ubuntu?
EpheMeroN, With the backports project
mako: fooooooooooooooood
mako!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11
what's that?
jordi: tio, no me envies sms's a mi, cuando se los quieres enviar a mako
ups
english
mooch: lol
how do i get more than 1 ip on a network card???
especialy since debian kernel on stable is way behind
there's no simple apt-get install firefox type command?
i already added the repositories listed on the user guide
tritium it worked. thanks
it would be apt-get install mozilla-firefox
Captain_Obvious: no
ah okay
and will that upgrade it to 1.0 without any issues?
EpheMeroN: it depends if you want to keep stable or move to development
I just want to upgrade to 1.0 and then install Java and Flash.
EpheMeroN: flash is in multiverse .... for java see the wiki
how stable is hoary this day? any outstanding issue?
k
First time that I ask to ask, but are KDE Ubuntu questions allowed ?
ogra: why is that?there are packages for flash on various platforms
kayali: better question....how stable is hoary tommorow ;)
nakee: i see only flashplayer-mozilla in synaptic.....
ogra: I was gonna ask it just after ;)
*g*
AMIGrAve: all questions allowed, but since not everyone uses kde, there aren't as many people who know the answers
JStrike: Thanks.  I'll take a look.
kayali: nobody can say .....
AMIGrAve: since ubuntu ust gets a community based branch called kubuntu....
AMIGrAve: KDE Ubuntu questions are allowed
ogra: kubuntu? do they have a homepage I could check?
kayali: no homepage yet, there's a wiki page
kayali: there was a talk in mataro at the conference... i think you can find somethink on the wiki
what wiki does ubuntu site uses?
|-)
yeah I heard about kubuntu but it is hard to get information about it except the wiki page on ubuntu
hmmm, setting up apache is a lot harder than i expected
AMIGrAve: what information would you like?
i want it to be setup like a production server but i dont what it should look like
i want multi-ips and multi-domains but all internal so what should i do???
<VirtualHost testlocal.localdomain>
and then edit the hosts.conf to testlocal.localdomain
how come I can't find 'smbmount' on my fresh warty install? I'm new to ubuntu and find it strange that it seems not to come with samba... since Nautilus fails to see the windows computer, I thought 'mount -t smbfs' would do, but it seems the kernel also comes without smbfs support...
anything I gotta do to be able to ssh to my ubuntu box?  I do a which ssh and it is in /usr/bin
hi
anyone tried the new debian drivers for nvidia instead of the 6111 ubuntu package?
Riddell: three things : 1) is it a very early project or is there already a preview running  2) is it as free as ubuntu and debian   3) If I want to help the project, what can I do, who should I contact ?
occy: install openssh-server, there is only the client by default
ogra: ahh, danke
1) warty is a proper release
1) been out since ocoter
hi@all
occy gern geschen
ogra: :)
:)
opps sorry, misread
i need some tools: lame galeon and limewire, how can i install this under ubuntu?
or what do i need to put into the /etc/apt/sources.list ?
AMIGrAve: it's a very early project, the only things that's been done is some packages have been uploaded to hoary which you can see in hoary-changes
ogra: ne idee?
derJunior, apt-get them. If they're not in the ubuntu repos, uncomment the "world" repositories (/etc/apt/sources.list)
AMIGrAve: it is of course Free Software and will be available at no cost once CDs are available
AMIGrAve: ask haggai if he comes around
no one knows how to mount a windows share with ubuntu?
naibed: hm i have uncomment the world repoitories
Kaloz, mount -t smbfs //IP/C /mnt/C -o WORKGROU=FOO,guest
AMIGrAve: 3) good question, what is your experience and skills, we don't have a mailing list yet unfortunatly, you can add comments on the wiki page
derJunior: dunno if galeon is in hoary, limewire depends on ava i think...
naibed: unsupported filesystem type...
kayali, try with smbmount (if you don't have it, install it)
ogra: hm i don't understand you
naibed: but doesnt smbmount come with samba?
kayali: go to "Network Servers" click on "File" click on "Connect to Servers"
Kaloz, with smbfs pkg
derJunior: there is no java in ubuntu.... so no limewire as it is a ava program
java
ogra, what?
ogra: oh okay but that is bad
i need java to
too
calc: wow, thanks... that worked ;)
derJunior: for java and lame: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
anyone got a wiki for apache??
oh there is a wiki
gread
great
ACID|net: www.apache.org ;)
Riddell: well I've not good skills in programming (just python, php, C# (yeah, I know ;-) and I did C long time ago,) as the required skills for KDE are around C++ i'm out of the game for that, but I want to learn deb packaging.
cenerentola: hi ;)
Does anyone know how can I join to rosetta project? I mean how can I register to be able to translate programs via web?
what's the name of the gnome RSS reader?
blam, or thunderbird
Riddell, apt-cache search gnome rss
blam doesn't show pictures, etc
i like liferea the best, but crashes every 2 seconds
well it did last time i tried it
calc, blam shows pics
Riddell: liferea is also a good one
ogra: ah, that's the one I was thinking of, thanks
I'm experiencing some troubles with a fresh installed Warty version on a Dell Dimension (8300): The grub boot loader hangs during the boot process: I just get some "GRUB, GRUB, ..." on the upper left corner. Any suggestions? Thanks.
grub is installed in the MBR. Maybe I should install it on the first partition.
eim, have a look at grub's bugs (more than ubuntu specific..)
naibed: I don't think it's a *real* grub bug but much more a miss-configuration.
for those running hoary, in the newly appeared debian menu, are there duplicates of all the entries?
eim: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HardwareSupportMachinesLaptops
linux_mafia, they put the Debian menu back in Hoary ?
ogra: I'll check, thanks.
linux_mafia: it will surely disappear soon
LinuxJones: its a bug i think.....
ogra, I hope so :D
LinuxJones, at the moment its there, i assume it will go soon
ftp://ftp.nerim.net/debian-marillat/ <-- this is the URL
but how can i put it into the sources.list
derJunior: is broken
hmmm, can't seem to get X to go into 1024x768 full screen.  It just makes the window smaller (from 1400x1050) onscreen.
what i syntax do i need
ogra: *grmL*
linux_mafia, there were some problems with X in Hoqry a few days ago, do you know it it has been fixed ?
nvidia?
isn't there a bot in here?
derJunior: marillat seems not to work anymore
ogra: hmkay and what can i use instead of this?
LinuxJones, i never noticed any problems, so cant say if its been fixed or not
updating WiFi Howtos, anyone there who wnderstands WiFi who can have a look?
derJunior: no idea, i personally use totem xine
linux_mafia, ok thanks
totem?
totem is sweet.
derJunior: totem-xine
ogra: is this another deb?
derJunior: yep
ogra: okay can you say me the link or the entry in the sources lsit?
ogra, do you have it working in hoary?
derJunior: its in universe http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/SynapticHowto
cool. an ubuntu channel
ogra: i am on console
:)
Pozac: totem xine? nope, i dont use my hoary box, i just play with it ;)
ogra, good choice :)
ogra: okay sorry, but what should i do with totem?
Pozac: wartyis for real work :)
it is a media player
derJunior: you showed the marillat url, so i thought you wanted mplayer
i need things like galeon lame java and some like this
ogra: okay mplayer is great too
can anyone say why i should switch from warty to hoary? i haven't understood the difference between them..
derJunior, u got a dvd player or burner?
ogra: but not without backports :)
derJunior: its all described on the restricted formats page
Pozac:only firefox.... ;)
nu-unxsaintaant_: why you ask me?
ogra: yes but the link is broaken you said
derJunior: not the link, the packages
derJunior: they dont work in ubuntu anymore
okay this isn't better
Rewop, you should not
derJunior: for hoary there is a working mplayer in multiverse
Rewop, hoary will be released in april
ogra: hm okay
Pozac: but in the forums everyone talks like if they have switched..
Rewop: hoary is unstable, breaks from time to time.....and is in steady flux
Pozac: aha
Rewop, because they can. It's free, though still in development. There are many great things going on in the free software world now, so for many - the newer the better :)
Pozac: ok
Rewop: its the version that is currently developed and will be the next stable release in april
yeh
so when you're done exploring and knowing all about warty, hoary is ready for you :)
and now for something completely different: ubuntu suffers some major norwegian language confusion
do i only have to change warty with hoary in my sources.list?
one second its bokml, next its danish, then its suddenly nynorsk
Rewop: but if you want to help to track bugs and dont care about the instabilities (and know how to fix certain things) hoary is for you
derJunior, yep
is there somewhere I can see a list of packages for ubuntu? I mean, the content of the repositories... I remember seeing that somewhere on the website
synaptic
ogra: i'm quite new to all this ubuntu stuff :) .. but why aren't they like upgrading the packages and stuff? in debian they did it all the time.. and for about 2 months ago they did it with ubuntu too, i think..
kayali, synaptic?
Pozac: I'm looking for a website
Rewop: not on my woody machine :)
ubuntu, ubuntu, oi oi oi
Rewop, warty is frozen....no more updates.....except for security
Rewop: they are upgrading hoary which is the current "unstable" ubuntu
kayali, I believe there is... somewhere..
Rewop: the stable release of debian only gets security updates, nohing else...as ubuntu stable does
aha.. so they were uprgading warty when IT was unstable..
now i get it..
Chibifs?
I don't get it.
Chibifs?
isnt localization an important goal for ubuntu?
hello?
Pozac: its a nick
the--dud: yep, it is.....thats why hoary just gets switched to utf8 everywhere
oh
ogra, how can i help in sorting out this awful norwegian translation then?
its terribly inconsistent
yesterday i tried to fix two monitors with two graphic cards to my computer, but it didn't work.. how do you do that? some talked about xinerama, but i couldn't find it for ubuntu.. is there another way?
the--dud, is it warty or hoary?
the--dud: the ubuntu-devel mailing list is the best start place i think..... and dile a bug in bugzilla.ubuntu.com
file
Rewop, its a feature in xfree86
warty
Rewop, xinerama is (I think) an extension for XFree/Xorg
i just became aware of the warty/hoary issue 5 minutes ago
Rewop, you need to reconfigure your XF86Config
the--dud: hmm, warty wont see any updates execpt critical stuff....
Pozac: ok.. how?
:)
I'm totally sure how except manually :(
perhaps its better in hoary
Rewop, RTFM :)
X -config
perhaps
the--dud, It's more up-to-date :)
Rewop: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
thanks, ogra
RuffianSoldier just spammed me
hey
pozac
nonono
wtf is up with that?
damn, when I import mp3s into rhythmbox, it tells me there's no plugin to handle that filetype... how funny ;)
ogra: i have done that.. but i can only configure one card.. at least what i saw..
ill have to verify that later, as im still using slackware on my primary machine
kayali, did you miss any gstreamer plugin?
you'll have to excuse my english.. i'm a foreigner :)
naibed: well, I just did a normal install...
the same to me :P
been waiting for my new harddrive, then ill install ubuntu on this one as well
Rewop: me too ;)
who isn't
how would I know if I had a stable version of unix?
kayali, apt-cache search gstreamer mp3
what's used in warty installation to detect the monitor and videocard?
djuuss: not everywhere though
nu-unxsaintaant_: if it doesnt boot into windoze
kayali, I think you need that
naibed: gstreamer0.8-misc - Collection of various GStreamer plugins
ogra: agreed, wether or not your a foreigner depends where "here" is
hehe
kayali, , gstreamer-mad - MAD MPEG audio decoder plugin for GStreamer
btw, i see on the wiki pages that there is a bounty out for a sound theme for hoary?
but i cant see it on the main bounty page
sound theme? make it not-annoying please. :>
the--dud: not sure if not already someone has claimed it
for some reason i update the list and upgrade yet gnome/xchat and many packages aren't updated
apt-get update
ah, shoot
apt-get upgrade
specially if it should fit with "hoary warthog"
the--dud: also a thing for the ubuntu-devel list ;)
(e.g. don't record your mom as a sound theme just because she fits the description)
hoary hedgehog?
Pozac: right
ogra, im well traversed with mailing lists thank you ;) im just chitchatting some here...
Why do I get an " A system error occurred. " error while trying to upload any translation with rosetta? Maybe a server problem or it' my fault?
prolly your fault
check your fwall and modem
djuuss, :? don't think it's a firewall problem..
hmm
why not
?
djuuss, because 1)I don't have any firewall (nor NAT) and 2) a problem with my fw/modem trying to send a POST ..?
when i setup my Shortcut Keys to pause music when i press ctrl-shift-s, i can't use the "s"-key after that, why is that?
can you send POST without rosetta?
djuuss, of course
naibed: are you logged in ?
and you got rosetta through apt?
ogra, yes
Rewop, sounds like a bug. Does it happen with other shortcut keys?
djuuss: rosetta is a server
djuuss, I mean the web..
apt-get install google.com
lol
i get it
Pozac: only with letters and numbers i think..
how can I disable IPv6?
Rewop: laptop ?
anyone can tell me how to update my linux, apt-get update... ^^^
??
then i don't know never tried
ogra: no
Rewop, Odd.
apt-get update
and then apt-get upgrade
thats it?
ok
thanks ! :)
update gets new package list, upgrade downloads the new packages
np
justin2: why do you want to disable IPv6? :)
djuuss: for rosetta: https://launchpad.ubuntu.com/
I get slow dns quaries
anyone else experienced the same? could someone just test if it works on their machines?
So anyone can confirm me that it's not my fault? :?
justin2: blame your ISP
Building Dependency Tree... Done
0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
does that mean that there is no update available?
D0wnXcaST, that's it
justin2: you can also use iptables to discard IPv6 packets
D0wnXcaST: looks like;)
because i juste re-install ubuntu, shouldn't have new update?
justin2: everywhere or only in certain apps ?
D0wnXcaST, you can dist-upgrade to hoary..
Hi all.
'lo plattypus1
I need help. I'm trying to get Ubuntu and a self-compiled kernel to get along.
plattypus1: why that ?
However, every time I try to boot it kernel panics, no root found.
plattypus1: did you create the initrd image?
naibed: what is this &
hoary?
D0wnXcaST: its the unstable development branch
Anyone can tell me what these 3 things mean? Assertion (heads < 256) at disk_dos.c:486 in function probe_partition_for_geom() failed.
Assertion ((C * heads + H) * sectors + S == A) at disk_dos:495 in function probe_partition_for_geom() failed.
plattypus1: then rebuild your kernel with support for the root filesystem in it.
plattypus1, what do you need a self compiled kernel for?
Assertion (heads > 0) at disk_dos.c:485 in function probe_partition_for_geom() failed.
D0wnXcaST: dont upgrade to it if you canz handle instability and breakage
cant
ok, than i wont upgrade to it
plattypus1: not as a module ("m") but directly as "y"
I'm new to linux, only 2 weeks now
:)
Snegec, an assertion is something that shouldn't happen :)
I assert that naibed is wrong
:o
Pozac, first, I think it helps performance, and second I want to make Linuxant's DriverLoader work and it doesn't like the kernel-source package.
;)
D0wnXcaST: did you already enable universe and multiverse to get more software ?
naibed: I reckon it's my hard drive.. but no test or anything detects it.. Windows Scandisk wont get past FAT and I get blue screens in windows at times something about VFAT(01).. but I can't install Linux cuz of this :()
plattypus1, ok.. it's probably the filesystem thing crimsun said
plattypus1: on ubuntu you dont use the kernel-source package
plattypus1: linux-source
ogra: yes before i re-installed linux, i had installed universe to have WINE.
guys I need help, left apt to update to hoary overnight, got errors configuring some packages, namely base-config , console-data and console-common.. yet checking most of the packages on finds that they weren't updated, although there's new versions of these packages in /var/cache/apt/archives and running apt-get upgrade again doesn't update them
plattypus1, I was... mere months ago
ill go an enable it
Snegec, make a backup and run fdisk to repair that..
:)
crimsun, that might be the problem...
plattypus1: the problem is more than likely related to the root filesystem's support being in the initrd, which you aren't using.
plattypus1: and for linuxant you only need the linux-headers package
naibed: run fdsik? Like? re-partition the drive?
ogra, every time it gives me errors that it can't find autoconf.h and version.h
Snegec, seems like a partition problem, isn't it?
plattypus1: you dont even have to reboot
naibed: I dont know
Naibed, seems like FAT problem if I was guessing
is hoary okay for day-to-day use?
plattypus1: got the build-essential package ?
or is everything pretty broken?
and FAT problem on primary drive..
build-essential?
plattypus1: autoconf, automake, gcc etc
in function probe_partition_for_geom() failed.
build-essential is all the gcc stuff
Yeah, I have those, though I apt-got them individually.
apt-sorry
i have a package manager question
plattypus1: looks like autoconf is missing according your error
ferris, yeh?
guys what package i need in order to run *.avi files?
plattypus1: version.h is only in the linux-headers-foo packages
i installed some programs the were all games... but I cannot find them
they are not under games folder
martin_, did you read the website?
ferris: how did you install the games?
ferris: look in /usr/games for the executables
It says that autoconf.h in /usr/src/linux/somethingorother is missing, then tries to use "/boot/config-2.6.8-1-3-386 on a temporary kernel tree"
through the synaptic package manager
plattypus1: read what I typed above :)
Pozac, remind me please which webiste.. im sorry, i have like 10 sites bookmarked, im sitting on the computer nonstop and finding more and more things i dont know and need to learn..
Hey. Does anyone know how to send a file over bluetooth to another devices (eg. cellphone) ?
checked the progs and chose apply
naibis: sigh.. oh well.. guess I'll have to reinstall all over again.. jeezus
plattypus1: there are plenty wiki pages how to install linuxant/slmodem drivers....look there, you only need the headers and build essential
Snegec, make a backup, then have a look with fdisk..
hello
martin_, go read here https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RestrictedFormats
I have support for the root fs in my kernel.
Quick one for someone :) - Ive installed Ubuntu and its all succesful, its on a dell inspiron 7500 - It goes through the verbose startup no problem, and once its all done that, the screen goes black, if I turn off the laptop, I see the login screen however the computer is shutting down. Ubuntu will load up if im using the live cd, anyone have any clues for this one :)
martin_, I use totem-xine :)
It's ext3, and both ext2 and 3 are y.
bye
ok ill use it too then :) thanks pozac.
plattypus1: and your motherboard chipset and HD drivers?
You're welcome, martin_ :)
how can I make a link (on the desktop) to /usr/games?
plattypus1: did you also disable initrd support?
the gui will not allow me to make link
I'm not a linux newbie, just not good with this distro. :)
plattypus1: the point with this distro is....you dont compile anything....
ferris, middle click and drag
plattypus1: ....you just use it
plattypus1, ubuntu needs portage!
did you start with stock kernel source from kernel.org, or are you using kernel-source-foo, or are you using linux-source-foo, or...?
ferris rightclick on desktop and select cfreate launcher
does it seem like there are more and more people switching from MS to linux?
ubuntu needs portage like a fish needs a bicycle
Pozac, That's what gentoo's for. I just don't want a source-based distro on a PII 233. :)
Pozac ????????
crimsun, yeah well the fish already has the full body water suit
ferris, whats ms? windows you mean?
then in command enter nautilus /usr/games
ogra?
hehe
ok ok.. ubuntu, for me, perhaps could might maybe use a little subset of some of portage
and maybe just one ebuild
yes
ugh.
Pozac: sudo apt-get build-dep <package> && apt-get source -b <package> is waaay better
portage is great, but keep it in Gentoo.
So where did you say the Linuxant wiki were?
ogra, I'm not convinced. :)
http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto at the bottom for example
dont suppose there are any US based ubuntu rsync servers?
ogra, thankies.
Pozac: tried ?
Pozac, can i get totem-xine from apt-get?
more specifically, for the cd images
the--dud: umn.edu?
Just freshly installed Warty. My serial mouse doesnt work. How can I fix this?
martin_, yes.. follow these instructions https://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/documentation/howto/helpcenterhowto.2004-10-20.3414506543/
thanks for the help on that
I believe totem-xine is in multiverse anyways
Pozac: universe
ogra, no.. don't care so much about that part, I care about it takes 3 minutes to make a new ebuild
crimsun, its not listed to have rsync on the wiki... but it might have anyway...
Pozac: depends on what you compile i guess
Agrajag, ok..
How "new" are the packages in ubuntu? same as debian?
'totem-xine' is in universe
ogra, apt has never been my friend, synaptic is my friend :)
(as Agrajag said)
Pozac: synaptic cant build packages (yet)
Pozac, i have totem-gstreamer and it seems to run the movie but i only get the sound without a picture... does that mean i just need divx codec? or should i dl xine?
get xine
hi Agrajag
apt-get install totem-xine
ok :)
martin_: get totem-xine
assuming apt works for you now
martin_, get totem-xine. the xine backend is better
martin_: from universe
martin_: do you have 'w32codecs' installed?
yeah Agrajag, works :)
ogra, thanks, ive set it up already
ogra, so I guess I'm not building packages then
crimsun, i dont know what that is
crimsun, should i get it from apt-get?
Pozac: normally there is no need for building them....
martin_: dpkg -l w32codecs|grep ^ii
Hi !
ogra, I know. I don't necessarily want to build the whole system :)
crimsun, man... could you please explain to me what dpkg does and means?
Does someone know the command line to create Ubuntu ISO CD when having just files and directory ?
Pozac: the idea that anything gets faster with self compiled binarys is a myth i think.....and what you gain through optimization is marginal regarding the work it needs
So here it is :) Ive installed Ubuntu and its all succesful, its on a dell inspiron 7500 - It goes through the verbose startup no problem, and once its all done that, the screen goes black, if I turn off the laptop, I see the login screen however the computer is shutting down. Ubuntu will load up if im using the live cd, anyone have any clues for this one :)
ogra, I just like that if I can see on the lists that a new gnome-panel has been released, I can copy gnome-panel-1.1 to gnome-panel-1.2 and install it (presuming nothing radically has changed)
hello guys
no packages found matching w32codecs|grep ^ii, crimsun
at least i cant connect to umn.edu through rsync ;/
Meleis: are you sure you don't want to just download an iso?
oh dpkg means download package?
on, dpkg handles Debian packages
martin_: 'w32codecs' is in Christian Marillat's repo. See the wiki under Restricted formats
ogra, I also find it a myth. Ubuntu works as fast or faster than gentoo :)
oh, d stands for debian?
yes
yep
folks, updated to hoary, no xorg.conf.  X -configure didn't work (or do I need to be out of X).  What was that deb-something command I need to get an xorg conf to appear?
crimsun, i did but the md5sum failed... so i mounted it and i did "md5sum -c md5sum.txt" he told me which files had problems, so i downloaded them again... they are ok. Now i would like to build the CD...
ok crimsun.. what is wiki btw?
guys, at boot the "starting hotplug subsystem" step takes 40 sec! any tip to speed up my boot?
tolstoy_: you need to be out of X :)
tolstoy_: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
martin_: it's explained on the wiki :)
djuuss: nope
you dont?
hows everyone doing?/
hey... I've done apt-get install nvidia-settings linux-restricted-modules-2.6.8.1-3-686     What do I need to do to setup nvida on this laptop?   ( nVidia GeForce2 Go chipset )
ftp.nerrim.net/debian-marrilat, crimsun?
occy: $ nvidia-glx-config enable
djuuss: nope, but i think you dont reconfigure it if it already rund....the changes take effect on next X startup then
i got that repository, xskoulax helped me out with that one, crimsun
runs
martin_: have you run apt-get update since adding it?
ill go run a search in synapt..
occy: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto
guys, at boot the "starting hotplug subsystem" step takes 40 sec! any tip to speed up my boot?
Agrajag, yi dont think i have, ill run it now
(ogra: notice how many people here are having apt-related problems)
Meleis: use mkisofs(8) to generate an .iso
perhaps you guys want to have a look at https://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/InstallingMplayerFromHoaryInWarty
martin_: k, after that you should be able to get w32codecs
Meleis: read the man page, or look for a how-to
nash, hoary's hotplug is much faster.
ogra: well if i were reconfiguring X i'd want to see what it changed, so beeing out of X isn't a bad idea, though not imperative perhaps
hi
Pozac: this will get better in hoary
ogra, seems like someone here did something different to get it working, but I'll try that.
ogra: k, tx, err... danke
heh
djuuss: ctrl-alt-backspace works here too ;)
nash: i'tll wear out
crimsun, ok i was just hoping a dev to be here and the things going easier... thanks anyway
You can get hoary's hotplug system for warty in the ubuntu backports.
Meleis: devs are in here
Agrajag, ok its all updated, ill try to get w32codecs
ogra: gotta love that combo :)
zenwhen: point me to some links
Meleis: fortunately your question can be answered with a quick Google search
i just did an apt-get upgrade ( running hoary) and my sound ceased to work.. none of the apps complain or report any errors but i dont *hear* any output ;--]  has anythnig changed recently in that regard ? any hints ? ..
weird.  updating to hoary didn't install the xorg server.  very weird.
crimsun : with xcdroad i can make some ISOs, but there are some files he resized cause of Joliet limitations
has it been released???
just now?
Nash: we better discuss this in #ubuntuforums ... the people in here dont like backport discussions.
ok, downloading :)
gilligan_, are you running KDE?
ogra: <-- rox
crimsun, xcdroad > xcdroast
ogra, they want their mplayers that work and new firefoxes?
Pozac: bah
hehe
Pozac: i have some kde packages installed but dont actually use it
ok zenwhen, thanks...
ogra, some people want improvements and dont have time to test a new distro.
ok, anyway, does anybody knows how to mount read-write (not read only) an ISO ?
Pozac: why - does that break anything?
Pozac:  i could live with the old ff.....i would still use it
gilligan_, Ok.. kmix sometimes sets the audio output to the SP/DIF channel
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ubuntu-bp/ thats the backports project
oh.. i found some error on startup..
ogra, Lets see what happens in a couple of releases :)
ogra, afterall, warty is a warthog
zenwhen: i know, i use the ff backport too, but there is really no need....and building a complete set of ff packages takes a lot of time....which i would rather see for improvements....
starting alsa.. /etc/rc2.d/S12alsa: Error: alsactl restore failed with message: alsactl: set_control:805: warning: name mismatch (DRC Switch/DRC Range ) for control #8
aslactl : set_control:892: bad contro.8.value type
i'm getting myself a dual boot of yoper, their site is back online so i'll try it out
any alsa experts around? ;-}
ok... :o(
zenwhen: so hoary will miss things again, because the manpower was missing ....
ogra, well If things like FF 1.0 arent going to be offered fro warty, someone needs to offer it.
have a nice day, bye
for*
ogra, has the manpower been missing?
zenwhen: why, 0.9.3 worked fine
people want the newest version
Pozac: every helping hand improves
ogra, thats not the point for most people. They want the newest version.
desktop people want the newest version
And ntohing will stop them from wanting it.
what for ?
pride
bah
freedom
ok
Its better that people run warty and still file bug reports on other packahges in it than switch to another diestro to get what they want.
distro*
talking about latest version.. when will OOo 1.1.3 make it into warty?
never
No.
Warty is frozen, it won't change.
unless you backport it
zenwhen: dont you think a 6 month release cycle is enough ? i can live 6 months with the current version
ogra: much better looking
arg
hey occy, how's the triath training going?
crimsun: did my first 21 miler sunday!
guess i'll back up my /home and try hoary
w00p
nice!
wpw
whew, it was work, that's for sure.
ciao
sites are down due to upgrade of the php bug.
ogra, many people can't. I dont see how backports hurt anyone. There are people who want a) updated software and b) stability. Backports + warty is just that.
gilligan_, try witch alsactl..
otherwise I'd point you to em'
:)
So here it is :) Ive installed Ubuntu and its all succesful, its on a dell inspiron 7500 - It goes through the verbose startup no problem, and once its all done that, the screen goes black, if I turn off the laptop, I see the login screen however the computer is shutting down. Ubuntu will load up if im using the live cd, anyone have any clues for this one :)
portage is excellent for this task
hello, guys, any good books on how to develop web applications using mono?!?! if that is possible?!?!
saif: whoa, slow down
How can I make my serial mouse work?
saif: yes, there's an excellent one. Hold.
zenwhen: i didnt say they hurt anyone.....i am just a little sad that the manpower gets lost on a dead dog
if you want newer than warty and not unstable - compile it yourself, using portage
crimsun: Mono: A Developer's Handbook? :)
or pkgsrc :P
hmmm
Bumjubeo, X error probably
was that too fast?!?! sorry! :)
at 1024x768 there is some wierd blurring of things
yeah .. if you have a week to spare
Bumjubeo, can you use CTRL-ALT-F1 to jump to a console when the screen is black?
darksatanic, edit ur XF86config, put /dev/tty0
let me just check that one
it's crystal clear at 1400x1050
(which I'd love to use by my almost 60 year old Mom would have issues with that res)
occy: why would you want to run X at a lower resolution then the max?
DaNewB, edit ur XF86config, put /dev/tty0 as input device in mouse section
ogra: If you want up-to-the-minute packages use hoary or gentoo. The 6-month cycle is designed for have a system that doesn't change little by little so it's easier to maintain and support.
Amaranth: thanx!! i'll chk it out!
bytecoder: see above :)
ogra, well it is a double edged sword. People would compile the apps themseleves if they wanted them. this just makes it easier. I refuse to run hoary until there is a preview ISO.
darksatanic, sorry that wasn't for u
Amaranth: heh, i know :)
Pozac, when i mark xine for installation it tells me that i need to remove gstreamer and desktop(?) and to install xine
ogra, I find it weird that people who give their software away in two versions - stable and unstable - cannot give their users stable updates for 6 months
to install xine*
martin_, Yes. Do it.
No matter how helpful it might be, I cannot be incovenienced with instability.
Amaranth: of course :)
zenwhen: i got an extra box for hoary testing and development :)
Prozac: ctrl-alt-f1 took me to the console yeah
zenwhen: You can't make a preview ISO of a constantly moving target. It literally changes every hour.
Pozac, ok.
saif: http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/monoadn/
zenwhen: but use warty for all my work
martin_, ubuntu-desktop is just a empty package to make sure you install all the stuff the ubuntu guys want you to have is there
saif: in fact, look here: http://www.mono-project.com/about/books.html
NewComer, thnks, i'll try
crimsun: I talk to the author from time to time on irc.gnome.org :)
Amaranth:)
martin_, and totem-xine conflicts with totem-gstreamer, which is needed by ubuntu-desktop :)
ogra, I have a warty server and a warty desktop. I am thinking baout building a third box for Hoary testing.
all righty! thanx a lot!
martin_: reinistall this package before you upgrade to the next stable version of ubuntu....many things will rely on it
saif: You probably want an ASP.NET book and the Mono one.
you could always install gstreamer-mad, which enables support for the "controversial" formats
Bumjubeo, login and edit your XF86Config
saif: The ASP.NET one will teach you how to use that and the Mono one will show you how to setup mono to use it for web sites.
awesome, thanks prozac!
I think you need to enable the debian marillat repository to get it, though
Amaranth: I don't think i need the asp.net one,
Bumjubeo, do you know what to do to fix it?
Amaranth: been developing c# for 2 years now!
Bumjubeo, I think your resolution might be too high by default or something
oh
Not really :) But I figured google could help me out instead of bothering you guys some more :)
saif: Then just get Mono: A Developer
err, that one :P
Amaranth: thanx for the advice though, will get the mono one!
grub-install has just destroied the boot-sector of an NTFS partition. Any ideas on how to recover it? Thanks.
Bumjubeo, I'll help you out
okay, sweet deal then :)
cool Pozac, it works :)
saif: If you want to talk to the author I believe he is edd on irc.gnome.org. He would be in #mono.
why does it take so much time to load though?
martin_: dont forget ygout the package on upgrade ;)
about
really?!?!
eim: Don't, use grub to boot windows.
saif: Yeah.
Bumjubeo, just open the file in your editor (nano -w /etc/X11/XF86Config), find the section with the resolutions and remove the highest one on all lines
nice nice! good to know that, i don't think i wanna bother him with stuff that i can read in books! if i run into walls or problems i'kk go there! :)
unless it's the resolution you intend to use and know the monitor can do, ofcourse :)
saif: Just ask him if his book has what you need. :)
martin_, np :)
martin_, Does it take a long time to load?
More than a couple of seconds?
Pozac: please dont forget to tell the people that ubuntu-desktop is very important on a stable to stable upgrade
Amaranth: thanx a milion! i'll go there then! c ya!
saif: See you there. :)
exit
:)
Pozac: there will be important things missing if they upgrade and the package is not there
martin_, the ubuntu-desktop package is very important when you upgrade to hoary in april
lo ppl
Pozac: thanks ;)
ogra, ok..
ogra, now, not to nag, but can't both totem's just provide a totem like portage?
Amaranth, is that edd dumbill, you talking about?
ogra, so it won't be removed when totem-xine is installed?
linux_mafia: Yeah.
ogra, that is, you must admit, kinda lame...
Amaranth, sweet, he seems like a pretty damn smart guy from what ive read
Pozac: nope, its a policy you have to make if you want to give professional support
hi m8s
does anybody know sth. about the root user?
i just made a new ubuntu cd image mirror in texas usa *_*
Pozac: i.e. no ubuntu-desktop..... unsupported software (universe SW)
I am new to ubuntu
So I did not find the root user
guru: did you read the thing before you created the account?
hm.noone else experiencing troubles with sound in hoary ?
ogra, but im amateur.. and will gladly support as much of universe as I can
guru: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo
guru: I mean the normal user account?
guru: sudo is your friend
guru: ubuntu is using sudo
pozac: Did I need to be root to edit XF86Config?
https://launchpad.ubuntu.com refuses connection :S
Pozac: thats fine....but canonical probably once wants to live from its supported part ;)
not really all the other distributions I tried had ther sth like normal user
Bumjubeo, yes.. sudo nano sorry :(
ahh np :)
gilligan_: nope. Sound's fine here.
guru: please read the wiki
naibed: so probably someone is working on it.....
ogra, I'm not sure what my helping out supporting what I use and know about has anything to with how canonical wants to live?
ogra, shit! XD
ok thx m8s
crimsun: hm.wonder what the hell happened.. it worked just fine before i did the apt-get upgrade..  whatever player I try, it doesnt complain.. but i get only silence..
Pozac: shh, there are a lot of canonical ppl here, they want to get paid ;)
Pozac: canonical made ubuntu possible..... who do you think pays for this all ?
ogra, However, any advice and comments on my behaviour is gladly appreciated, don't get me wrong
Bad Gateway: the proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
gilligan_: well, what player are you using?
NewComer, after editing XF86Config, what do I do?
ogra, I know I know
AndyR: please no spam, thanks :)
crimsun: doesnt matter.same for whatever i try
ogra, Does this mean I cannot help you support these poor noobs?
Pozac: we're all "noobs"
Pozac: please...stop using the work "noobs"
gilligan_: what sound hardware?
crimsun, I too..
Pozac: so let them make the policy they need for pro support and enjoy the benefit you get from the freeness of their distro ;)
what happened to apt in hoary?  I keep getting "unknown error executing gpgv" when I do an apt-get update  Anyone have an idea how to rectify this?
everyone is in a learnin stage...
scizzo, sorry
crimsun, hardly spam, but i wont do it again
AndyR: much appreciated.
crimsun: powerbook.. onboard sound.. worked fine before..
what's the difference between package nfs-kernel-server and nfs-user-server ?
Chibifs
Pozac: universe is not supported by canonical....and will never be i guess, so they need you for this....
yes
And certainly, I will make sure the .. people.. know the true implications of their actions
And remind them how they must use their package manager to break their video players before they upgrade. :)
heh
crimsun: thanks for asking :)
sadly
Pozac: you must not......but it will cause much more support not telling them.....
occy: np, I remember my own marathon training. :)
crimsun: yeah?
crimsun: how come you don't hang out in #fitgeek?
Pozac: ubuntu/canonical/gnome simply decided to support gstreamer (which is totem) and only one videoplayer will be in the supported stuff
:)
occy: didn't know of it til just now :)
hehe
check out fitgeek.org too
ogra, Yeh, but ubuntu-desktop is not only supported, it's also required
cool, thanks :)
ogra, don't you think the package manager should take care of that?
Pozac: only on upgrade
yeh
only when needed
like I don't need ubuntu when my computer is off
Pozac: but you would read upgrade notes bfore you upgrade ?
ogra, Maybe
they will mention this ....
well
how does it create more support then?
rosetta keeps giving me errors when i try to change add some translations >_<
:)
the ppl that dont read upgrade notes ;)
Anyone got ideas on how to get an Zip250 Atapi seen in Warty?
load ide-floppy
I'm a Wintel newbie.  How do you load ide-floppy?
are their any apps for ubuntu, that would let someone read their hotmail accounts?  want to use t-bird, but hotmail uses http-mail, instead of pop3.
BuckyG, add it to /etc/modules
