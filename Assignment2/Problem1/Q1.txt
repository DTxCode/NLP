1.5:
Looking at words labelled as 'poss' (possession modifier) in the dependency tree, it is clear that many nouns are being mis-labelled as 'poss'.
One possible reason for this may be spaCy's handling of apostrophes; if spaCy is splitting up apostrophes, then for nouns that were modifiers like "Jack's book",
spaCy may label "Jack" as 'poss'. Reduction of this error may depend on configuration of spaCy's parsing.

Looking at words labelled as 'cc' (coordinating conjuction) in the dependency, it seems that the words 'of' and 'plus' are often being mis-labelled as
coordination conjuctions. 'Plus', while not a coordinating conjuction, is at least a type of conjuction. 'Of' however is always a preposition.
The cause of this error may be due to similarities between where the word 'of' appears in a sentence and where conjunctions typically appear.
