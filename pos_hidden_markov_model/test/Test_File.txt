As
already
noted
in
an
earlier
paragraph
,
the
more
familiar
cost
analyses
of
utility
enterprises
or
utility
systems
divide
the
total
costs
among
a
number
of
major
classes
of

residential

commercial

industrial
power
,
street

Since
this
book
is
concerned
only
incidentally
with
railroad
rates
,
it
will
not
attempt
to
analyze
the
methods
by
which
the
staff
of
the
Interstate
Commerce
Commission
has
estimated
out-of-pocket
costs
and
apportioned
residue
costs
.
< EOS >
< sentence ID = 5 >
The
general
basis
on
which
these
common
costs
are
assigned
to
differently
measured
units
of
service
will
be
illustrated
by
the
following
highly
simplified
problem
of
an
electric-utility
cost
analysis
.
< EOS >
< sentence ID = 6 >
Instead
,
all
of
the
total
costs
are
treated
as
variable
costs
,
although
these
costs
are
divided
into
costs
that
are
deemed
to
be
functions
of
different
variables
.
< EOS >
< sentence ID = 7 >
This
latter
assumption
will
permit
us
to
center
attention
on
the
most
controversial
aspect
of
modern
public
utility
cost
analysis
--
the
distinction
among
costs
that
are
functions
of
outputs
of
the
same
service
measured
along
different
dimensions
.
< EOS >
< sentence ID = 8 >
But
in
any
event
,
full
credit
should
be
given
to
the
Cost
Section
for
its
express
and
overt
recognition
of
a
vital
distinction
too
often
ignored
in
utility-cost
analyses
:
namely
,
that
between
a
cost
allocation
designed
to
reflect
the
actual
behavior
of
costs
in
response
to
changes
in
rates
of
output
of
different
classes
of
utility
service
;
;
< EOS >
< sentence ID = 9 >
This
``
grand
division
''
permits
many
costs
to
be
assigned
in
their
entirety
to
some
one
class
,
such
as
street
lighting
,
or
at
least
to
be
excluded
completely
from
some
important
class
or
classes
.
< EOS >

In
the
first
subtype
,
the
analyst
(
following
the
practice
of
railroad
analysis
in
this
particular
respect
)
distributes
both
total
operating
costs
and
total
annual
capital
costs
(
including
an
allowance
for
``
cost
of
capital
''
or
``
fair
rate
of
return

)
among
the
different
classes

units
of
